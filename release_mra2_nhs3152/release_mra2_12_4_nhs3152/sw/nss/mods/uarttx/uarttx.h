/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_UARTTX uarttx: Uart Tx-only module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * The Uart Tx module provides a way to transmit byte sequences over the SSP interface using the UART protocol.
 * This module will hide all details of the SPI driver: it will initialize and configure the driver. The user of
 * the Uart module only needs to use the API functions below to have tracing functionality over a UART interface.
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity, to ease the transmission of data according to each application's needs.
 *  Check @ref MODS_NSS_UARTTX_DFT for all diversity parameters.
 *
 * @par Setup
 *  - Connect the MOSI pin (PIO9) to the RX pin of e.g. an FTDI FT232R.
 *  .
 * @note The unused SSP pins (PIOs 2, 6 and 8) can still be used as GPIO for other purposes
 *
 * @par Warning
 *  When this module is in use, it is not possible to directly access the SPI driver for either transmission or
 *  reception. Doing so can result in communication errors or even a hard fault.
 *
 * @par Example 1
 *  @snippet uarttx_mod_example_1.c uarttx_mod_example_1
