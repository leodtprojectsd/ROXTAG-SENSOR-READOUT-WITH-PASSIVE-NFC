/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_MSG_DFT Diversity Settings
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS_MSG
 * The message handler module allows the application to enable or disable certain behavior through the use diversity
 * flags in the form of defines. Sensible defaults are chosen; to deviate, simply define the relevant flags and message
 * ids in your application before including the message handler module.
 *
 * @par Flags
 *  - Flags to enable application specific commands and responses:
 *      - #MSG_APP_HANDLERS,
 *      - #MSG_APP_HANDLERS_COUNT and
 *      - #MSG_CATCHALL_HANDLER.
 *      .
 *  .
 *
 * @par Special message ids
 *  - #MSG_ID_GETVERSION is a special message id, as it is always enabled - see #MSG_ENABLE_GETVERSION. @n
 *      There are two related flags for this id:
 *      - #SW_MAJOR_VERSION and
 *      - #SW_MINOR_VERSION.
 *      .
 *  - #MSG_ID_GETRESPONSE is a special message id, as it is automatically enabled when you expand the functionality of
 *      the message handler module to use a buffer, i.e. by defining both
 *      - #MSG_RESPONSE_BUFFER and
 *      - #MSG_RESPONSE_BUFFER_SIZE,
 *      .
 *  - #MSG_ENABLE_PREPAREDEBUG is a special message id, as it is automatically enabled and disabled based on the build
 *      configuration - specifically, when DEBUG is defined or not. It can be overridden using #MSG_ENABLE_PREPAREDEBUG
 *  - #MSG_ID_GETDIAGDATA is a special message id, as it is automatically enabled when the diag module is enabled -
 *      which is automatically included in the chip library and enabled by default. It can be overridden using
 *      the diag module diversity setting #ENABLE_DIAG_MODULE
 *  .
 *
 * @par Additional hooks to control the flow
 *  - #MSG_COMMAND_ACCEPT_CB
 *  - #MSG_RESPONSE_DISCARDED_CB
 *  .
 *
 * @par Other message ids
 *  A few predefined message id's are also enabled by default, and can be disabled in an application's app_sel.h:
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_GETUID
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_GETNFCUID
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_GETCALIBRATIONTIMESTAMP
 *      .
 *  All other predefined message id's are disabled by default, and can be enabled in an application's app_sel.h:
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_RESET
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_READREGISTER
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_WRITEREGISTER
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_READMEMORY
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_WRITEMEMORY
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_PREPAREDEBUG
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_GETUID
 *      - #MSG_ENABLE_CHECKBATTERY
 *      .
 *
 * @par Example
 *  To override each and every diversity flag that the message handler module offers, create defines that are known to
 *  the precompiler before including the message handler module.
 *  The recommended way to do this is to add the code below to @c app_sel.h
 *  @code
 *      #define MSG_APP_HANDLERS_COUNT 15
 *      #define MSG_APP_HANDLERS <name of MSG_CMD_HANDLER_T array>
 *      #define MSG_CATCHALL_HANDLER <name of pMsg_CmdHandler_t function>
 *      #define SW_MAJOR_VERSION 4
 *      #define SW_MINOR_VERSION 2
 *      #define MSG_RESPONSE_BUFFER_SIZE 65
 *      #define MSG_RESPONSE_BUFFER <name of uint8_t buffer>
 *      #define MSG_COMMAND_ACCEPT_CB <name of pMsg_AcceptCommandCb_t function>
 *      #define MSG_RESPONSE_DISCARDED_CB <name of pMsg_ResponseCb_t function>
 *      #define MSG_ENABLE_RESET 1

 *      #define MSG_ENABLE_CHECKBATTERY 1
 *      #define MSG_ENABLE_GETCALIBRATIONTIMESTAMP 1
