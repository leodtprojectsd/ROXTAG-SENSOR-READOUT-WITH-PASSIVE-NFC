 *  @par Maintaining state
 *      It is a crucial feature of this module to be able to resume operation at all times. Between de-initialization
 *      and re-initialization anything can happen, and no volatile memory can be trusted. Still, speed of operation is
 *      necessary. To be able to restore the exact state - done in #Storage_Init - three different recovery structures
 *      are used:
 *      - #RecoverInfo_t - stored in the general purpose registers
 *      - #Hint_t - stored on a fixed location in EEPROM
 *      - #Marker_t - stored on a variable location, immediately after the last written sample in EEPROM
 *      .
 *      After recovery, state is maintained in SRAM using the structure #Storage_Instance_t, and in #Storage_DeInit at
 *      least two of the three recovery structures are updated.
 *      @n The recovery structures are linked to each other as explained below.
 *
 *      - #RecoverInfo_t
 *          This data is stored in the designated ALON register #STORAGE_FIRST_ALON_REGISTER and is by far the fastest
 *          and easiest way to recover the current state. It is always tried first. If its data is non-zero, the
 *          information is trusted and used.
 *      - #Hint_t
 *           This data is stored in the last page of the assigned EEPROM region, and also enables recovery of the
 *           current state in a fast way. However, this structure may be out of date as it may not be updated at every
 *           change.
 *           The reason for not updating is to ensure the maximum number of writes (endurance) is never reached.
 *           However, this data will always accurately tell
 *           - whether samples are stored or not
 *           - how much flash is occupied by data storage
 *           .
 *           It also provides a possible location to #Marker_t, which may be outdated.
 *      - #Marker_t
 *           This data is always stored just after the last sample written in EEPROM. Its precise location is not known,
 *           as it is progressing together with the data. #RecoverInfo_t points to the start of this structure in the
 *           assigned EEPROM region; #Hint_t may point to it; if both are failing a full slow search is performed in the
 *           assigned EEPROM region.
 *      .
 *
 *      When a full backward search is performed during data recovery, we rely on the length of the marker to eliminate
 *      false positives, i.e. to ensure no bit sequence exists that looks like a valid marker but are in reality one or
 *      more samples stored in EEPROM. The comments near the code in #FindMarker explain the length and value of the
 *      marker avoid finding false positives. Yet, although extremely improbable, there is still a very tiny possibility
 *      that real-life data being stored in EEPROM results in such a false positive.
 *      Even then, most applications will never have the need to perform a full backward search, evading this problem.
 *      If your application is more likely to hit this, due to the use case being sufficiently different, and due to the
 *      samples being sufficiently similar, this module can be adapted to erase the full EEPROM after moving all data to
 *      FLASH - see #MoveSamplesFromEepromToFlash. During our continuous tests using randomized data of different
 *      lengths, we have never encountered this problem and therefore decided not to suffer the extra cost (time and
 *      power consumption) of implementing this.
 *
 *  @par Recovering
 *      In #Storage_DeInit, at least the ALON register (#RecoverInfo_t) and the EEPROM marker (#Marker_t) are updated.
 *      Assuming only one sample was added, the EEPROM contents would then change as visually depicted below:
 *
 *      @note the pictures below use this legend:
 *          - @c aaa, @c bbb, ... @c fff: samples, with bitsize #STORAGE_BITSIZE
 *          - @c AA: ALON register, formatted according to #RecoverInfo_t
 *          - @c HH: hint, formatted according to #Hint_t
 *          - @c MMMMMMM: marker, formatted according to #Marker_t
 *          - @c BB: block info, of size #FLASH_DATA_HEADER_SIZE
 *          - @c xxxx: block bytes, the (compressed) data bytes moved from EEPROM and now stored in FLASH
 *          .

 *
 *      The ALON register will then point to the new location of the marker; while the hint will not be updated and will
 *      for sure contain faulty information.

 *
 *  @par Data corruption
 *      When the battery is degrading, two scenarios can cause a corruption:
 *      - the supplied voltage drops too much during a flash operation, hanging the IC or causing a reset. This can
 *          corrupt the FLASH portion being written to.
 *      - the supplied voltage drops too much during an EEPROM operation, hanging the IC or causing a reset. This can
 *          corrupt the EEPROM row being written to.
 *      .
 *      The storage module can be fully resilient against this: no data present in the non-volatile memories EEPROM and
 *      FLASH is lost and all samples can still be read out, with one exception: the samples written after the last
 *      update to the hint structure cannot be recovered, as no duplicate information is yet available.
 *
 *      After a hard reset, the general purpose registers are reset to 0, and the samples temporarily stored there are
 *      also lost. This brings the total number of minimum lost samples to
 *      #STORAGE_WRITE_RECOVERY_EVERY_X_SAMPLES + #STORAGE_SAMPLE_ALON_CACHE_COUNT - both are diversity settings the
 *      application can set.
 *
 *  @par Using EEPROM @b and FLASH
 *      Both EEPROM and FLASH are used to store data - in the form of equisized samples. Since writing to EEPROM is
 *      cheaper, faster and less complicated than writing to FLASH, it is the preferred storage medium. Whenever the
 *      size of all the samples stored in EEPROM is large enough - see #STORAGE_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES - all that data is
 *      moved in one operation to FLASH. EEPROM is then completely empty, and new samples are then in EEPROM again.
 *
 *      The memory content changes are visually depicted below. If writing a new sample would increase the size to equal
 *      to or higher than #STORAGE_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES, first the EEPROM contents are moved, then the new sample is
 *      written.

 *
 *  @par Caching data
 *      To reduce the number of EEPROM flushes, data is initially @b not stored in non-volatile memories EEPROM and
 *      FLASH. Instead, the reserved general purpose registers are used to cache the data. The value is preserved
 *      when entering and leaving a deep power down, but any inadvertent reset clears the registers, losing the data.
 *      This is not a disadvantage, since the cached data will be moved to non-volatile memory before writing the hint
 *      The benefit is a reduction of the required EEPROM program operations. This helps in avoiding the write
 *      endurance limit even when storing massive amounts of data, and also reduces the stress on the battery when it
 *      nears end-of-life.
 *
 * @anchor storage_initializing_par
 *  @par Initializing
 *      The implementation of #Storage_Init tries to recover the complete state as fast as possible. This can be done
 *      when either the recovery info or the hint information points to a valid marker structure. When a slow search
 *      is required, the initialization function make sure a next call will be fast.
