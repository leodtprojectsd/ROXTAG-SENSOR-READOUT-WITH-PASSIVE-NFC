/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_STORAGE_DFT Diversity Settings
 *  @ingroup MODS_NSS_STORAGE
 *
 * The application can adapt the storage module to better fit the different application scenarios through the use of
 * diversity settings in the form of defines below. Sensible defaults are chosen. To override the default settings,
 * place the defines with their desired values in the application app_sel.h header file. The compiler will pick up your
 * defines before parsing this file.
 *
 * Additional notes regarding some flags:
 * - By default, the assigned EEPROM region takes up 2KB and is located just below the read-only EEPROM rows. This
 *  storage space can be moved and resized by adapting #STORAGE_EEPROM_FIRST_ROW and #STORAGE_EEPROM_LAST_ROW.
 * - By default, the remaining FLASH memory after programming is used for data storage: the available free
 *  FLASH space is automatically determined. It can also be manually assigned: move and resize the storage space in
 *  FLASH by adapting #STORAGE_FLASH_FIRST_PAGE and #STORAGE_FLASH_LAST_PAGE.
 * - Data is stored decompressed in EEPROM; a chance is given to the application to compress the data before it is moved
 *  to FLASH. For this, define both #STORAGE_COMPRESS_CB and #STORAGE_DECOMPRESS_CB.
 * - Flash operations should be used sparingly. The amount of data transferred as one block from EEPROM to FLASH can be
 *  controlled using #STORAGE_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES. Too little data puts unnecessary strain on the battery and reduces
 *  compression abilities; too much data risks a portion of the FLASH to remain not utilized when a compressed block of
 *  samples no longer fits.
 * - The storage module requires the use of at least one general purpose register. This cannot be disabled.
 * .
 *
 * These flags may be overridden:
 * - #STORAGE_FIRST_ALON_REGISTER
 * - #STORAGE_SAMPLE_ALON_CACHE_COUNT
 * - #STORAGE_EEPROM_FIRST_ROW
 * - #STORAGE_EEPROM_LAST_ROW
 * - #STORAGE_FLASH_FIRST_PAGE
 * - #STORAGE_FLASH_LAST_PAGE
 * - #STORAGE_TYPE
 * - #STORAGE_BITSIZE
 * - #STORAGE_SIGNED
 * - #STORAGE_WORKAREA
 * - #STORAGE_WRITE_RECOVERY_EVERY_X_SAMPLES
 * - #STORAGE_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES
 * - #STORAGE_REDUCE_RECOVERY_WRITES
 * - #STORAGE_COMPRESS_CB
 * - #STORAGE_DECOMPRESS_CB
 * .
 *
 * These defines are fixed or derived from the above flags and may not be defined or redefined in an application:
 * - #STORAGE_EEPROM_ROW_COUNT
 * - #STORAGE_EEPROM_SIZE
 * - #STORAGE_MAX_SAMPLE_ALON_CACHE_COUNT
 * - #STORAGE_WORKAREA_SELF_DEFINED
 * - #STORAGE_WORKAREA_SIZE
 * - #STORAGE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES
 * - #STORAGE_BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE
 * - #STORAGE_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_BITS
 * - #STORAGE_MAX_LOSS_AFTER_CORRUPTION
 * - #STORAGE_UNCOMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_BITS
 * - #STORAGE_UNCOMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_BYTES
 *
 *  @par Choosing correct values
 *      The storage module has many diversity settings, and can be tweaked a lot. Storing data reliably and as
 *      efficient as possible is a complex operation, and every use case will need to adjust a few settings, not
 *      relying on the default values.
 *
 *      To start, determine the correct sizes of the three memory regions the storage module has exclusive access of:
 *      - General purpose registers: determined via #STORAGE_FIRST_ALON_REGISTER
 *          More general purpose registers means more data can be cached before writing to EEPROM. The more are
 *          assigned, the less EPROM flushes are performed, which prolongs life for batteries with a higher battery
 *          impedance (think printed batteries). But when things fail, all these samples will be lost.
 *      - EEPROM: #STORAGE_EEPROM_FIRST_ROW and #STORAGE_EEPROM_LAST_ROW
 *          By default, a conservative choice is made, leaving ~2 kB alone, for other uses of the application.
 *          The larger the assigned region, the more samples can be stored. This means less room left for the
 *          application to store its state, events and validation results.
 *      - FLASH: #STORAGE_FLASH_FIRST_PAGE and #STORAGE_FLASH_LAST_PAGE
 *          By default, all space not used by the program itself, is used for data storage by the storage module.
 *          Unless your application requires to write to flash for other purposes, it is advised to stick with the
 *          default settings.
 *      .
 *
 *      Next, determine what will be stored. Each sample given to the storage module must have the same type. Both
 *      basic types and structures or unions are possible. Each sample will be placed back to back, without a single
 *      padding bit; if you know that a few MSBits are always 0, you can choose to store fewer bits, resulting in a
 *      larger storage capacity.
 *      - #STORAGE_TYPE
 *      - #STORAGE_BITSIZE
 *      - #STORAGE_SIGNED
 *      .
 *
 *      Compression greatly increases the number of samples that can be stored, at the cost of the size of the
 *      compression library itself. Normally, the compression ratio is greater when more samples are compressed at
 *      once.
 *      The storage module allows you to insert function calls to compress and decompress a large number of
 *      samples automatically. @n
 *      Keep in mind that enlarging #STORAGE_UNCOMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_BYTES also enlarges
 *      #STORAGE_WORKAREA_SIZE, and the memory required for compressing and decompressing.
 *      - #STORAGE_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES
 *      - #STORAGE_COMPRESS_CB
 *      - #STORAGE_DECOMPRESS_CB
 *      .
 *      If a compression is to be used which operates on a single sample at a time, the application can wrap the calls
 *      to the storage module and implement this outside the storage module. An example of this is a mapping operation
 *      which reduces the resolution in specific value ranges.
 *      Be sure to adapt the type and bitsize to match the encoded values.
 *
 *      Data recovery is paramount. Especially when at the end of the use case lifetime, when dealing with batteries
 *      which can't maintain a stable voltage any more, the risk of data corruption increases. The chance for data
 *      corruption to occur is highly dependent on your specific application, your choice of battery, and your
 *      environmental conditions. And apart from data corruption, the IC might also reset during flushing of EEPROM data,
 *      or during a FLASH program operation. When any of this happens, the storage module must be able to return as
 *      many samples as possible.
 *      @n The storage module ensures only a few most recent samples may get lost.
 *      - The samples stored in the general purposes registers were already mentioned. The number can be defined exactly
 *          using #STORAGE_SAMPLE_ALON_CACHE_COUNT
 *      - If data corruption occurs in EEPROM - or when data corruption in EEPROM is suspected - none of the data in
 *          the affected row can be used anymore. The storage module therefore stores a copy the last data row on a
 *          fixed location.
 *          Since the write endurance limit per EEPROM row is only 10.000, the storage module cannot copy this each
 *          time. Via the setting #STORAGE_WRITE_RECOVERY_EVERY_X_SAMPLES the application can decide, taking into
 *          account the maximum number of samples that are to be stored.
 *          If in your use case less than 30.000 samples are stored over the full lifetime of the product, this value
 *          would then be set to 3.
 *      - If data corruption occurs in FLASH, the program will avoid all FLASH operations thereafter. No samples are
 *          lost, but the total storage capacity diminishes, as the FLASH page where the corruption occurred and all
 *          higher FLASH sectors will not be used for data storage any more.
 *      - Writing recovery information in itself can also have an averse impact on the battery. The application is
 *          therefore given an additional choice: the number of EEPROM flushes due to writing recovery data can be
 *          halved, at the expense of an additional 8 bytes of samples which may get lost when data corruption occurs.
 *          If #STORAGE_REDUCE_RECOVERY_WRITES is enabled, only one row is reserved for recovery information, and only
 *          56 bytes are duplicated.
 *      .
 *      The maximum amount of samples that may get lost due to an unexpected reset, a battery failure, or a data
 *      corruption, is captured in #STORAGE_MAX_LOSS_AFTER_CORRUPTION
 *      To recover all samples safe for the very last, at the expense of (a lot) more EEPROM flush operations, use these
 *      settings:
 *      @code
 *          #define STORAGE_SAMPLE_ALON_CACHE_COUNT 0
