/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_STORAGE storage: NVM Storage module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * The storage module allows an application to store samples <strong> all of identical size</strong> in non-volatile
 * memories EEPROM and FLASH.
 *
 * It will:
 * - abstract away where and how the samples are stored
 * - provide an easy interface via which samples can be written to and read from
 * - utilize all bits, placing all samples back to back, maximizing storage capacity
 * - minimize FLASH program operations, thereby avoiding the time penalty, voltage drop and current consumption that
 *  comes with every FLASH program operation
 * - move data from EEPROM to FLASH automatically whenever necessary to make sure the newest data is always in EEPROM
 * - allow application-specific compression of the data just before moving data from EEPROM to FLASH
 * - allow application-specific decompression of the data before they are read out again
 * - recover its full state based on the contents of the non-volatile memory alone
 *
 * The storage module will use general purpose registers, EEPROM and FLASH to store bits of data. The usage of the
 * three types of memories is prioritized. When a new sample is to be stored:
 * - first an attempt is made to store it in the general purpose registers ("cached").
 * - when this is not possible, the storage module tries to store it (together with all the cached samples) in EEPROM
 *  @n After moving data to EEPROM, the general purpose registers are re-used.
 * - only when a sufficient amount of samples are stored in EEPROM, all the data is moved to FLASH.
 *  @n After moving data to FLASH, the EEPROM is re-used.
 * .
 * Writing samples always means appending them to the already written samples; it is not possible to edit the already
 * written stream of bits.
 * When reading out, the user can control the starting read position using a sequence number. It is automatically
 * deduced where the corresponding sample is written, whether it is compressed, and what needs to be done to be able to
 * return the requested sample(s).
 *
 * @par Hardening
 *  The storage module provides a ready-made solution to maximize storage of samples in persistent memory. It can:
 *  - store more than 10.000 samples without hitting the write endurance limit of both EEPROM and FLASH
 *  - recover state from unexpected resets
 *  - recover all or most of the samples in case of data corruption (this may occur when the battery is degraded and
 *      can no longer supply the minimum voltage when the load increases during a write operation in EEPROM or FLASH)
 *  .
 *  It is not possible to fully recover data under all circumstances. The storage module guarantees that only the last
 *  few samples may get lost. The number is dependent on the number of the reserved general purpose registers and the
 *  size of a sample, both of which (and more) can be tweaked using diversity settings.
 *
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity settings. Some settings define the type and size of the sample. Others define the
 *  EEPROM and FLASH regions placed under control of this module. The rest of the settings control the behavior of the
 *  module. Check @ref MODS_NSS_STORAGE_DFT for all diversity settings.
 *  @n
 *  It is expected that each application that requires this module includes it and configures the diversity settings of
 *  the module according to its specific needs.
 *
 * @par Memory Requirements
 *  The storage module requires a large chunk of SRAM, called its workarea - see #STORAGE_WORKAREA and
 *  #STORAGE_WORKAREA_SIZE. This is used for two purposes:
 *  - When storing samples, and a move from EEPROM to FLASH is required, the assigned compress callback - see
 *      #STORAGE_COMPRESS_CB - is given a pointer inside this SRAM memory. The output is then stored in FLASH.
 *  - When reading samples from FLASH, the assigned decompress callback - see #STORAGE_DECOMPRESS_CB - is called as
 *      little as possible: its output is cached in the work area to speed up subsequent reads.
 *  .
 *  If two operations in your code require such a big chunk of memory, you can overlap them if they don't have to
 *  operate concurrently. Diversity setting #STORAGE_WORKAREA can be used for this.
 *
 * @par How to use the module
 *  -# Define the best diversity settings for your application or accept the default ones.
 *  -# Initialize the EEPROM driver and the storage module, in that order.
 *  -# Read and write samples as necessary, in any order or quantity that is required for your use case.
 *  -# De-initialize the storage module and the EEPROM driver, in that order.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Example
 *  @snippet storage_mod_example_1.c storage_mod_example_1
 *
 * @warning These functions are not re-entrant. Calling these functions from multiple threads or in an interrupt is
 *  highly discouraged.
 * @warning The storage module requires the exclusive use of @em at @em least @em one register in the always-on domain
 *  (see #STORAGE_FIRST_ALON_REGISTER). Under no circumstance may the reserved registers be touched from outside the
 *  storage module.
 * @warning Although the storage module is able to recover after a power loss or going to Power-off, it is slow in doing
 *  so. The slow recovery time only occurs once as long as no changes to the NVM are made (e.g. by calling
 *  #Storage_Write).
