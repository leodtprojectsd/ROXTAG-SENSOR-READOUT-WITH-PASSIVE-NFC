/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_EVENT event: event bookkeeping module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * This block of code allows an application to store disjoint events. Events can be retrieved using a few basic
 * filtering techniques. @n
 *
 * Events can:
 * - are stored with a timestamp
 * - can be retrieved in various ways
 * - not be deleted
 * - be changed, in a limited way (only the extra optional data section, if provided for).
 *
 * It will use the designated portion of the EEPROM to:
 * - store data of arbitrary size together with a timestamp and an unrestricted tag value.
 * - allow retrieval of data sequentially, based on a time range, or a specific tag value.
 * .
 *
 * The event bookkeeping module main purpose is to store sparse but noteworthy events. Only EEPROM is used, and only a
 * limited portion thereof. Events also take considerable space; once the assigned memory is full, no new events can be
 * stored. Typically, only a handful events of each 'type' - each is then given a different tag value is expected to
 * be stored.
 *
 * Examples are:
 * - Storing configuration, start and stop times.
 * - Storing error conditions such as memory full or BOD.
 * - Storing read-out moments
 * - Storing use case specific data, such as location-aware data given by an NFC reader a few times during the active
 *  lifetime of the IC.
 * - Storing the time of the first excursions, and/or the time when the validation algorithm decided the product is no
 *  longer fit for consumption.
 * - Storing any application-specific data, that is not required for the temperature logging and monitoring
 *  functionality, but is necessary to better integrate within the full solution.
 * When reporting events, a lot of extra information is provided, allowing an application to easily fetch similar
 * events, or neighboring events.
 *
 * It is expected that each application that requires this module includes it and configures the diversity settings of
 * the module according to its specific needs.
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity: settings to define the type and size of the EEPROM region placed under control of
 *  this module. Check @ref MODS_NSS_EVENT_DFT for all diversity parameters.
 *
 * @par How to use the module
 *  -# First call #Event_Init to prepare the module.
 *  -# After that, at any time, call #Event_Set to append a new event.
 *  -# To retrieve data, use one of the #Event_GetByIndex, #Event_GetByTime, or #Event_GetByTag.
 *      The configured callback will be called for each event that matches the given constraints until all memory has
 *      been searched.
 *  -# To ensure that all data is flushed in EEPROM, call #Event_DeInit as the last call between two sessions
 *  .
 *
 * @par Example
 *  We define two different values to be used as 'tag':
 *  @snippet event_mod_example_1.c event_mod_example_1_defines
 *  Two variables are used to check the outcome of the calls to the callback:
 *  @snippet event_mod_example_1.c event_mod_example_1_variables
 *  The function @c EventCb is defined as value for @c EVENT_CB in the diversity settings:
 *  @snippet event_mod_example_1.c event_mod_example_1_callback
 *  The main code is then storing and checking a total of 6 datasets at three distinct times.
 *  @snippet event_mod_example_1.c event_mod_example_1

 * Whenever data is requested via a call to #Event_GetByIndex, #Event_GetByTime or #Event_GetByTag,

 * @param tag The tag value associated with the data.
 * @param offset Absolute EEPROM Offset, in bytes, from where to start reading the associated data.
 *  The offset is relative to #EEPROM_START and can be given unmodified as @c offset argument in a call to

 *  There are two special values, #EVENT_CB_OPENING_INDEX and #EVENT_CB_CLOSING_INDEX, whose usage can be controlled via
 *  #EVENT_CB_OPENING_CALL and #EVENT_CB_CLOSING_CALL. When used, an extra call is made, @b not indicating a valid
 *  event. Use these extra calls for preparing or concluding running activities.
