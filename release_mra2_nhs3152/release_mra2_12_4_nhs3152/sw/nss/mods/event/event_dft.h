/** @defgroup MODS_NSS_EVENT_DFT Diversity Settings
 *  @ingroup MODS_NSS_EVENT
 *
 * The application can adapt the Event module to better fit the different application scenarios through the use of
 * diversity flags in the form of defines below. Sensible defaults are chosen; to override the default settings, place
 * the defines with their desired values in the application app_sel.h header file: the compiler will pick up your
 * defines before parsing this file.
 *
 * Additional notes regarding some flags:
 * - By default, the assigned EEPROM region takes up 1KB and is located just below the RO EEPROM rows. This storage
 *  space can be moved and resized by adapting #EVENT_EEPROM_FIRST_ROW and #EVENT_EEPROM_LAST_ROW.
 * .
 *
 * These flags may be overridden/set:
 * - #EVENT_EEPROM_FIRST_ROW
 * - #EVENT_EEPROM_LAST_ROW
 * - #EVENT_CB
 * - #EVENT_CB_OPENING_CALL
 * - #EVENT_CB_CLOSING_CALL
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE
 * .
 *
 * These defines are fixed or derived from the above flags and may not be defined or redefined in an application:
 * - #EVENT_EEPROM_ROW_COUNT
 * - #EVENT_EEPROM_SIZE
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE_A
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE_B
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE_C
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE_D
 * - #EVENT_OVERHEAD_CHOICE_E
