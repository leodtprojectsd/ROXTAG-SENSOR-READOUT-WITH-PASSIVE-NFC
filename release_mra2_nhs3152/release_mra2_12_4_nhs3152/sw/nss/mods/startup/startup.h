/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_STARTUP startup: Startup and exception handlers
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * This module implements the vector table for all exceptions.
 * It also implements default handlers for all exceptions.
 *
 * There are two flavors of exceptions: exceptions internal to the CPU core (the ARM), and exceptions external to the
 * CPU core. The former are dictated by ARM and occupy the first 16 slots. The latter are dictated by the (peripherals
 * of the ARM) and occupy slot 16 and onwards. The external exceptions are also referred to as (peripheral) interrupts,
 * and have their own numbering.
 *
 * An example of a peripheral interrupt is a timer overflow. An example o an ARM internal exception is the hard fault
 * exception. A special case is the first ARM internal exception: reset.
 *
 * The startup module has a common implementation for every handler. The implementation consists of an ASSERT(false)
 * followed by an infinite loop. Only the reset handler has a real implementation, see below.
 *
 * All handlers have a so-called "weak" implementation. This means that the application can override them by declaring a
 * handler with exactly the same name/signature.
 *
 * @par Details on reset
 *  This module implements the reset handler. The implementation should be sufficient for most applications. However,
 *  the ResetISR is a weak implementation, so an application has the option to override it.
 *  The implementation of the reset handler consists of 3 steps:
 *      -# Initialization (cq zeroing) of all variables
 *      -# Initialization of the runtime lib (C++ only)
 *      -# Calling main
 *      .
 *  There is a fourth step: when main returns (should never happen), there is an assert and hang.
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Implement timer interrupt handler
 *  When using a timer interrupt, the default handler for the timer needs to be overridden. Declare a function with the
 *  exact name '#CT16B0_IRQHandler':
 *  @snippet startup_mod_example_1.c startup_mod_example_1_ct16b0
 *
 *  The following code configures and starts the timer:
 *  @snippet startup_mod_example_1.c startup_mod_example_1_main
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Firing a hard fault to own handler
 *  Declare a function with the exact name '#HardFault_Handler' to override the default hard fault handler:
 *  @snippet startup_mod_example_2.c startup_mod_example_2_hardfault
 *
 *  The following code causes a hard fault by calling an illegal address:
 *  @snippet startup_mod_example_2.c startup_mod_example_2_main
 *
 * @par Example 3 - Overriding the reset vector
 *  Include the function with the exact name '#ResetISR' to override the default reset handler. The most basic
 *  implementation is shown. It initializes (c.q. zeros) all variables, and calls main():
 *  @snippet startup_mod_example_3.c startup_mod_example_3_resetisr
