/** @defgroup MODS_NSS_TMEAS tmeas: Temperature measurement module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * The temperature measurement module provides a simple yet flexible API allows the user to measure temperatures, 
 * choosing the measurement resolution and the output unit of measurement.
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity, like defining a callback at link time.
 *  Check @ref MODS_NSS_TMEAS_DFT for all diversity parameters.
 *
 * @note This mod provides an implementation of the interrupt vector
 *   #TSEN_IRQHandler and enables and disables the interrupt #TSEN_IRQn.
 *   By including this mod you can thus no longer use the interrupt driver functionality.
 * @note This mod will initialize (enable a clock and provide power) the TSEN driver (by calling
 *   #Chip_TSen_Init) prior to making a measurement, and de-initialize it when the measurement
 *   is complete. Using the TSEN HW block directly is thus highly discouraged when using this mod.
 * @note This mod will by default use the temperature calibration values as determined during production at the factory
 *   site. When a recalibration is in order, these values can be changed by changing the registers
 *   #NSS_TSEN_T.SP1, #NSS_TSEN_T.SP2 and #NSS_TSEN_T.SP3 for the
 *   @c a, @c b resp. @c alpha parameters. See the temperature application note for details on this recalibration.
 *
 *  @par Example 1: measure temperature, waiting for the result
 *  @snippet tmeas_mod_example_1.c tmeas_mod_example_1
 *
 *  @par Example 2: measure temperature, receive the result in a callback
 *  Callback:
 *  @snippet tmeas_mod_example_2.c App_TmeasCb
 *  Main code:
 *  @snippet tmeas_mod_example_2.c tmeas_mod_example_2
