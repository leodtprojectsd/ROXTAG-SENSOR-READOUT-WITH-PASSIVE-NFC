/** @defgroup MODS_NSS_COMPRESS compress: compression / decompression module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * This block of code allows an application to perform losless compression and uncompression on arbitrary chunks of
 * data. @n
 * It will:
 * - abstract away how the samples are compressed and uncompressed,
 * - provide an easy interface via which data of any length compressed and uncompressed,
 *
 * The Compress module will use both EEPROM and FLASH to store bits of data. The newest samples are always stored in
 * EEPROM; when the reserved space in EEPROM is full, all the data is moved to FLASH, and the EEPROM is reused.
 * Writing samples always means appending them to the already written samples; it is not possible to edit the already
 * written stream of bits.
 * When reading back again, the user can control the starting read position using a sequence number. It is automatically
 * deduced where the corresponding sample is written, whether it is compressed, and what needs to be done to be able to
 * return the requested sample(s).
 *
 * It is expected that each application that requires this module includes it and configures the diversity settings of
 * the module according to its specific needs.
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity: settings to tweak the effectiveness of the compression.
 *  Check @ref MODS_NSS_COMPRESS_DFT for all diversity parameters.
 *
 * @par Memory Requirements
 *  The memory requirements are defined by the diversity settings. Check #COMPRESS_WINDOW_BITS and #COMPRESS_USE_INDEX.
 *
 * @par How to use the module
 *  -# To compress, simply call Compress_Encode. No preparation or initialization is necessary.
 *  -# To uncompress, call Compress_Decod. No preparation or initialization is necessary.
 *  -# Compress_Decode o Compress_Encode is an identity function.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Example
 *  @snippet compress_mod_example_1.c compress_mod_example_1
