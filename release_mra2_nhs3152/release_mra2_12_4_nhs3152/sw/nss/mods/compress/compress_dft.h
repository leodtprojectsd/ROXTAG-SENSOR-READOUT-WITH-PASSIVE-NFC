 * diversity flags in the form of defines below. Sensible defaults are chosen; to override the default settings, place

 * use 2^8 == 256 bytes, while a value of 10 will use 2^10 == 1024 bytes. The latter uses more memory, but may also
 * compress more effectively by detecting more repetition.
 * It is a buffer size parameter that is explicit trade-off between compression effectiveness and working memory.
 * - required stack size for compression: 16 + 2<<w if no index is enabled.
