/**
 * @defgroup MODS_NSS_NDEFT2T ndeft2t: NDEF Type-2 Tag Message creator/parser Module
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * NDEFT2T module provides the API to handle creation and parsing of NDEF messages on a Type 2 Tag. The record types
 * which are currently supported are NFC Forum well known types TEXT and URI, NFC Forum External types and MIME.
 *
 * The NDEFT2T module provides the following functionalities:
 * - Creation of an NDEF message consisting of one or more supported record types.
 * - Parsing of an NDEF message and extracting the supported record types.
 * .
 *
 * @par NDEF:
 *  The NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) specification defines a message encapsulation format to exchange information,
 *  e.g. between an NFC Forum Device and another NFC Forum Device or an NFC Forum Tag. NDEF is a lightweight, binary
 *  message format that can be used to encapsulate one or more application-defined payloads of arbitrary type and size
 *  into a single message. More details of this format can be referred from the NFC Forum specification available at
 *  http://members.nfc-forum.org/specs/spec_list/.
 *
 * @par Memory Requirements:
 *  The NDEFT2T module does not allocate any static R/W data memory. Instead, the caller should take care of the
 *  allocation of the memory required for the creation/parsing of the NDEF message. The NDEFT2T module memory
 *  requirements are contributed from the entities given below:
 *  - Instance Buffer: The instance buffer preserves the necessary housekeeping information during an instantiation
 *     of the NDEFT2T module. A new instantiation is made either when #NDEFT2T_CreateMessage() or
 *     #NDEFT2T_GetMessage() is called. The caller must ensure that the argument pInstance passed to these
 *     functions points to a buffer of size #NDEFT2T_INSTANCE_SIZE bytes. The caller must also ensure that
 *     the memory allocated for this buffer starts on a 32-bit aligned address in RAM.
 *  - Message Buffer:  NDEFT2T module uses this buffer to initially create the NDEF message consisting of one or
 *     more records before finally copying the same to the shared memory. Similarly, during parsing, the entire
 *     message is initially copied to the message buffer and the constituent records are then parsed from that. The
 *     caller must ensure that the variable pBuffer passed when calling the functions #NDEFT2T_CreateMessage() or
 *     #NDEFT2T_GetMessage() has sufficient space to create/parse the entire NDEF message. However, it is safe to
 *     allocate a size of #NFC_SHARED_MEM_BYTE_SIZE (which stands for the size of the shared memory) in case the
 *     caller is not sure of the size of the NDEF message being created or parsed. The caller must also ensure that
 *     the memory allocated for this buffer starts on a 32-bit aligned address in RAM and has a size that is a
 *     multiple of 4.
 *  - Record information structure: The exchange of type information (main type and extended properties) for the
 *     record being created or parsed is achieved through the data structures #NDEFT2T_CREATE_RECORD_INFO_T and
 *     #NDEFT2T_PARSE_RECORD_INFO_T respectively. In the case of message creation, the caller must allocate and
 *     fill in the relevant fields of #NDEFT2T_CREATE_RECORD_INFO_T to input the information of the record to
 *     create. Similarly, in the case of parsing, the caller must allocate NDEFT2T_PARSE_RECORD_INFO_T and process
 *     the information received about the record getting parsed.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Initialization/De-initialization:
 *  The module has to be initialized before a message creation or parsing, at the start of application processing.
 *  This has to be done after initializing the NFC HW block (see #Chip_NFC_Init) by calling #NDEFT2T_Init.
 *  Similarly, the module can be de-initialized by calling #NDEFT2T_DeInit followed by de-initialization of the
 *  NFC HW block (see Chip_NFC_DeInit) after the application processing is complete. Note that the
 *  Initialization/de-initialization of the NFC HW block is not done inside the module and hence has to be done
 *  at application level in the order mentioned above.
 *
 * @par NDEF Message creation:
 *  The below steps outline the NDEF message creation:
 *  - Step1: Call #NDEFT2T_CreateMessage to instantiate a new NDEF message and prepare for adding constituent
 *      records into it. The caller must ensure to allocate sufficient memory for the arguments pInstance and
 *      pBuffer before calling the above function.
 *  - Step2: Create one or more records in the instantiated NDEF message by following the procedure listed below
 *      till all records have been created.
 *      - Create record: Call one of the functions #NDEFT2T_CreateTextRecord, #NDEFT2T_CreateUriRecord
 *          #NDEFT2T_CreateExtRecord or #NDEFT2T_CreateMimeRecord for creating NFC Forum well known types TEXT and URI,
 *          NFC Forum External types or MIME.
 *          The caller must ensure to initialize relevant fields of the record information argument pRecordInfo
 *          before calling the above functions.
 *      - Copy record payload: Call the function #NDEFT2T_WriteRecordPayload to copy the record payload to the
 *          message buffer.
 *      - Finalize record: Call the function #NDEFT2T_CommitRecord to finalize the record.
*       .
 *  - Step3: Call function #NDEFT2T_CommitMessage to finalize the NDEF message. The user cannot add any more
 *      records after this. The finalised message is copied to the shared memory at this stage.
 *  .
 *
 * @par NDEF Message Parsing:
 *  The below steps outline the NDEF message parsing:
 *  - Step1: Call function #NDEFT2T_GetMessage to copy the NDEF message from shared memory into the message buffer.
 *      The caller must ensure to allocate sufficient memory for the arguments pInstance and pBuffer before calling
 *      the above function.
 *  - Step2: Call the function #NDEFT2T_GetNextRecord to search and retrieve the next record present in the NDEF
 *      message. The caller can then check the returned record information from the argument pRecordInfo and decide
 *      whether this record type is relevant for the application scenario.
 *  - Step3: Call the function #NDEFT2T_GetRecordPayload to retrieve record payload.
 *  .
 *  Continue steps 2 and 3 above till all the relevant records have been retrieved or till end of message.
 *
 * @anchor nfcIntHandling_anchor
 * @par NFC Interrupt Handling:
 *  This module provides an implementation of the interrupt vector #NFC_IRQHandler and controls the interrupt #NFC_IRQn.
 *  By including this module, the application can no longer instantiate the NFC interrupt handler and may no longer
 *  enable, disable or clear the corresponding interrupts.
 *  The interrupts which are enabled all the time are #NFC_INT_RFSELECT, #NFC_INT_TARGETWRITE and #NFC_INT_NFCOFF
 *  interrupts. However, #NFC_INT_MEMWRITE and #NFC_INT_TARGETREAD interrupts are also enabled/disabled internally by
 *  the module during NDEF message creation.
 *  Two callback functions are provided to the application, of types #pNdeft2t_FieldStatus_Cb_t and
 *  #pNdeft2t_MsgAvailable_Cb_t. These are called from the interrupt handler.
 *  - The callback function of type #pNdeft2t_FieldStatus_Cb_t provides the current status of the NFC field (ON or OFF)
 *      as obtained inside the interrupt handler.
 *  - The callback function of type #pNdeft2t_MsgAvailable_Cb_t gets fired once per message, indicating the presence of
 *      a valid NDEF message in the shared memory. This can be used as a trigger for the application to start the
 *      parsing of a new NDEF message.
 *  .
 *  The application has to implement these callbacks and enable them by using the respective diversity settings
 *  #NDEFT2T_FIELD_STATUS_CB and #NDEFT2T_MSG_AVAILABLE_CB.
 *
 * @note The #NFC_INT_TARGETWRITE and #NFC_INT_TARGETREAD interrupts are internally configured by the module to occur
 *  for page 6 of the NFC Tag memory as seen from RF side or page 2 of the NFC shared memory.
 *
 * @anchor colDetDesc_anchor
 * @par Shared memory access collision detection:
 *  This feature allows detecting a collision in case of a simultaneous read/write access from both the APB-side and
 *  RF-side from/to the shared memory. The data that is getting read from the APB-side can get corrupted due to a
 *  simultaneous data write from the RF side. In a similar way, the data that is getting written from the APB-side
 *  can also get corrupted. The collision detection feature allows detecting such a corruption and the read or write
 *  attempt can be retried for a specified number of times by using respective diversity settings (See
 *  @ref MODS_NSS_NDEFT2T_DFT).
 *
 * @par Record and Message Header overheads
 *  An NDEF message has few record and message header bytes in addition to the record payloads. The overhead in bytes
 *  required for these header bytes can be obtained using the macros #NDEFT2T_TEXT_RECORD_OVERHEAD,
 *  #NDEFT2T_MIME_RECORD_OVERHEAD, #NDEFT2T_EXT_RECORD_OVERHEAD, #NDEFT2T_URI_RECORD_OVERHEAD and
 *  #NDEFT2T_MSG_OVERHEAD. Knowing the overhead will enable the application writer to know the bytes left in the
 *  shared memory for the record payload. An example usage is given below for a message with a TEXT and MIME record each
 *  being a short record and the total message payload size being less than 255 bytes:
 *  - overhead = NDEFT2T_MSG_OVERHEAD(true, (NDEFT2T_TEXT_RECORD_OVERHEAD(true, sizeof("en")-1) +
 *                                           NDEFT2T_MIME_RECORD_OVERHEAD(true, sizeof("nhs31xx/demo.nhs.log")-1));
 *  .
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity, like enabling/disabling collision detection and also to specify the number of
 *  read/write retries in case of a collision.
 *  Check @ref MODS_NSS_NDEFT2T_DFT for all diversity parameters.
 *
 * @par Example1 - Creating an NDEF Message with a single record of type TEXT
 *  NDEF messages consisting of a single record of types MIME, AAR and URI can be created in a similar way as given in
 *  this example.
 *  @snippet ndeft2t_mod_example_1.c ndeft2t_mod_example_1
 *
 * @par Example2 - Creating an NDEF Message with one TEXT record and one MIME record
