 * When enabled via #NDEFT2T_EnableAutomaticMode, the provided callback is executed @b under @b interrupt each time the
 * NFC tag reader has read the last page of the NDEF message in the NFC shared memory.
 * @note This functionality stops working when the NFC tag reader starts writing any write in any page disables the
 *  'automatic mode'. Re-enable it by calling #NDEFT2T_EnableAutomaticMode again. Note that the firmware may not get
 *  notified of this: only when a full NDEF message is written, the application supplied #NDEFT2T_MSG_AVAILABLE_CB is
