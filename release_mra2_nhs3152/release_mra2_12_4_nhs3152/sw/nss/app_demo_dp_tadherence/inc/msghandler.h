 *  -# It makes use of:
 *      - @ref NFC_NSS as its communication channel.
 *      - @ref TIMER_NSS (Timer 0) to implement a Host-Timeout detection mechanism.
 *      - @ref MODS_NSS_MSG module to implement a command/response mechanism.
 *      - @ref MODS_NSS_NDEFT2T to generate/parse NDEF formatted messages.
 *      .
 *  -# The supported command ID's are described by #MSGHANDLER_MSG_ID_T enum
 *  -# The specifics of the protocol are described in the documentation section of the @ref MODS_NSS_MSG module
 *  -# The content of the commands and responses defined by the Therapy Adherence demo application
 *      are described by @ref APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_MSGHANDLER_PROTOCOL.
 *  -# It is also responsible for sending and receiving the data to the underlying physical communication channel
 *      (NFC interface).
