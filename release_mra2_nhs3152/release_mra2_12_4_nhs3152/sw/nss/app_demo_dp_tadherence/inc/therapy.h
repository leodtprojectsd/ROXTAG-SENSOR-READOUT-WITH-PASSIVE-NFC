/** @defgroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY Therapy Component
 *  @ingroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE
 *  The Therapy Adherence Therapy Component is responsible for managing the therapy adherence status.
 *  It makes use of:
 *      - The @ref APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_MEMORY module to store its internal data into non-volatile memory.
 *      - The @ref APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY_SENSE module to sense the presence/removal of the pills.
 *      .
 *  Via the Therapy Component, other components can:
 *      -# Check the current state of the therapy.
 *      -# Start a new therapy.
 *      -# Stop an ongoing therapy.
 *      -# Reset the status of the therapy to pristine state.
 *      -# Force an update of the internal status.
 *      .
 * @par Groups:
 *  The available pills in the blister are divided into groups. Each group is defined by its drive pin (HW connection).
 *  Depending on the sensing principle, a group can have one ore more sensing pins.
 *  Depending on the sensing principle, a group can be capable of:
 *      - Sensing a specific individual pill removal.
 *      - Sensing the number of removed pills, this means all pills in such a group are treated as equals.
 *      .
