/**
 * @defgroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY_SENSE_SPECIFIC_GPIO_DFT Diversity settings for the GPIO sensing principle
 * @ingroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY_SENSE_SPECIFIC
 * These 'defines' capture the diversity settings of the compound.
 * It keeps the settings about 'sensing groups', it actually holds the configurations of the demo board/smart blister.
 *
 * @par Principle
 *  This principle is based on GPIO functionality, each pill has a unique combination of Drive/Sense pins.
 *  By putting a Pull-up resistor on the sense line (input) (SW configurable), and Pulling the Drive line LOW (output),
 *  the logic level on the sense line indicates the absence of a pill.
 *
 *@par Limitations
 *  There is one limitation for this principle, all SENSE lines need to have pull-up resistors.
 *  Most pins have the possibility to configure them in SW (in chip pull-up), however,
 *  PIO0_4 and PIO0_5 (I2C) do not have this feature, hence they can only be used as drive line OR in combination
 *  with an external pull-up.
 *
 *@par Setup
 *  There are 2 possible setups, which both use the same sensing principle:
 *      -# No extra components; there are 12 GPIO pins available, at least 1 shall be used as drive line. @n
 *          Setup:
 *          @code
 *              GPIO DRIVE o----------------------     ...
 *                            |     |     |     |
 *                            p1    p2    p3    p4      ...
 *                            |     |     |     |
 *              GPIO SENSE1 o--     |     |     |
 *              GPIO SENSE2 o--------     |     |
 *              GPIO SENSE3 o--------------     |
 *              GPIO SENSE4 o--------------------
 *                  ...
 *          @endcode
 *          This setup results in a maximum of 11 manageable pills.
 *      -# diode matrix; by adding 1 diode per pill, a matrix can be formed. @n
 *          Setup:
 *          @code
 *              GPIO DRIVE2 o-------------------------------- ...
 *              GPIO DRIVE1 o-------- ...             |     |
 *                 ...        |     |                 |     |
 *                            _     _                 _     _
 *                            ^     ^                 ^     ^
 *                            |     |                 |     |
 *                           p1.1  p1.2 ...          p2.1  p2.2 ...
 *                            |     |                 |     |
 *                            |     |                 |     |
 *                            |     --o GPIO SENSE1 o--     |
 *                            --------o GPIO SENSE2 o--------
 *                                          ...
 *          @endcode
 *          This setup results in a maximum of 36 manageable pills, a matrix of 6 drive and 6 sense lines.
