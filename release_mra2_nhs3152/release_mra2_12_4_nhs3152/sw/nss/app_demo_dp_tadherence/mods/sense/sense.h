/** @defgroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY_SENSE Sensing Component
 *  @ingroup APP_DEMO_TADHERENCE_THERAPY
 *  The Therapy Adherence Demo Sensing component is responsible for providing a normalized and simplified interface to handle
 *  pill presence sensing. It is also responsible for managing the sensing circuit and configuration of the sensor(s).
 *  Its functionality is simplified down to on single API function to trigger the sensing.
 *  The application will be triggered via a callback function at the moment that an event occurs.
 *
 * @par Memory Requirements:
 *  The SENSE module does not allocate any static R/W data memory. Instead, the caller should take care of the
 *  allocation of the memory required for the SENSE configuration storage.The SENSE module memory
 *  requires an Instance Buffer: The instance buffer preserves the necessary housekeeping information during an
 *  instantiation of the SENSE module. The caller must ensure that the argument pInstance passed to
 *  #Sense_SensePillRemoval points to a buffer of size #SENSE_INSTANCE_SIZE bytes.
 *  The application is responsible to preserve this instance between 2 sense actions.
