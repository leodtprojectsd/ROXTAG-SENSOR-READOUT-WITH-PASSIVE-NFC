 * This part defines possible diversity for the resistive sensing principle.
 *
 * With this sensing method there are 2 possible principles as defined by #SENSE_RES_SENS_PRINC_T.
 * For both these principles, the pill vector is deduced from the admittance of the network/ladder.
 * To determine the admittance, both the voltage and the current are measured.
 * The following procedure is followed:
 *  -# The drive pin is driven by the DAC.
 *  -# Using the ADC the voltage of both the drive and the sense pin is measured.
 *  -# These values are combined to calculate the voltage drop caused by the resistive network/ladder.
 *  -# Using the I2D the current is measured (flowing into the sense pin), this current is equal to the current
 *      flowing through the network/ladder.
 *  -# The admittance of the network is then equal to the current divided by the voltage drop.
