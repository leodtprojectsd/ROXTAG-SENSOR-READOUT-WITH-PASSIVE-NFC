/**
 * @defgroup NFC_NSS NFC: Near field communication driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * Near Field Communication (NFC) driver provides the API to control the functionalities handled by the NFC HW block.
 * The NFC driver provides the following functionalities:
 *  -# Initializing/Deinitializing of the NFC HW block
 *  -# Enabling/Disabling and clearing of the Interrupts
 *  -# Retrieving the NFC HW block status bits
 *  -# Retrieving information about last RF access
 *  .
 *
 * @par NFC HW Interface:
 *  The NFC HW block is based on a MIFARE Ultralight EV1 block which is responsible for the wireless NFC communication
 *  with an external reader. Detailed functionality of the Mifare Ultralight EV1 can be referred from the user manual.
 *
 * @par Memory organization and access:
 *  The IC has a shared memory region which is overlaid on the EEPROM area of the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 block. The NFC
 *  shared memory can be accessed by the ARM core over the APB bus and also by an external contact-less reader. The
 *  access by the ARM core will henceforth be referred to as "APB side access" and the access by an external reader as
 *  "RF side access". The exchange of data over the RF from an external reader and the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 block is
 *  in units of pages which is of 4 bytes in size. The memory organization of the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 block is also
 *  in the same manner. The first 4 pages is an EEPROM block and that can only be accessed from the RF side and not
 *  from the APB side. The next 128 pages is the shared memory and that can be accessed from both the RF side as well
 *  as the APB side. This shared memory space is followed by 3 special registers which are status register, incoming
 *  command register and outgoing command register. The rest of the EEPROM area follows this and is accessible from
 *  RF side. However, access to this area is not recommended.
 *
 * @note The driver does not provide functions to access the shared memory and direct access has to be used by the
 *  higher layers for this. The shared memory access can be referred from example 1 and example 2 given below.
 *
 * @warning The shared memory is writable only as 32-bit words to 32-bit aligned addresses from the APB side.
 *  Reading can be done as a byte or a 16-bit word or a 32-bit word from 32-bit aligned address space.
 *
 * @par Incoming/Outgoing Command registers:
 *  These are the registers #NSS_NFC_T.CMDIN and #NSS_NFC_T.DATAOUT listed below register structure. These registers
 *  could be used by applications to exchange custom commands between the SW running on the ARM core and an external
 *  NFC Reader. The NFC driver does not provide functions to access these registers. The #NSS_NFC_T.CMDIN register
 *  is writable from the RF side and only readable from the APB side. Similarly the #NSS_NFC_T.DATAOUT register is
 *  writable from the APB side and only readable from the RF side.
 *
 * @par Interrupt Handling:
 *  This block has multiple interrupt sources tied to the same NFC IRQ. Refer to #NFC_INT_T for more details.@n
 *  The interrupts can be enabled/disabled by using the #Chip_NFC_Int_SetEnabledMask function. The interrupt flags can
 *  be selectively cleared using #Chip_NFC_Int_ClearRawStatus function.
 *
 * @par Status information:
 *  The status information of the NFC HW block can be retrieved by using the #Chip_NFC_GetStatus function. Refer to the
 *  enum #NFC_STATUS_T for more details.
 *
 * @par Last RF access information:
 *  This feature provides the following information with respect to the last access made from RF side. This can be
 *  retrieved using the #Chip_NFC_GetLastAccessInfo function.
 *  -# Start word offset in BUF for the last RF access.
 *  -# End word offset in BUF for the last RF access.
 *  -# Direction (read/write) of last RF access.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Additional Information:
 *  <dl><dt> NDEF: </dt><dd>
 *      This term stands for NFC Data exchange format and more details about this can be referred from the technical
 *      specification available on NFC Forum website. </dd>
 *  <dt> TLV: </dt><dd>
 *      This term stands for "Type Length Value" and more details about this can be referred from Type 2 Tag operation
 *      technical specification which is also available on NFC Forum website. </dd></dl>
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Simple NDEF Message Write
 *  The below example demonstrates how a simple NDEF message can be written to the shared memory which can then be read
 *  by an external reader. Refer to @ref MODS_NSS_NDEFT2T for a simplified API to handle NDEF Messages.
 *  @snippet nfc_nss_example_1.c nfc_nss_example_1
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Simple NDEF Message Read
 *  The below example demonstrates how a simple NDEF message can be read from the shared memory which was previously
 *  written by an external reader. This example assumes that the message written by the external reader is of length
 *  less than 255 bytes and no additional TLVs are present before the NDEF TLV.
 *  @snippet nfc_nss_example_2.c nfc_nss_example_2

 * @par Example 3 - Using NFC interrupt for external reader access detection
 *  @snippet nfc_nss_example_3.c nfc_nss_example_3
 *  Handle interrupt:
 *  @snippet nfc_nss_example_3.c nfc_nss_example_3_irq
 *
 * @par Example 4 - Using NFC interrupt for detecting read/write to particular page offset and getting
 *  information about last RF access.
