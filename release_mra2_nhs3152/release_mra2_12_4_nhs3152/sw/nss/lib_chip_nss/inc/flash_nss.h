/** @defgroup FLASH_NSS flash: Flash driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Flash driver provides APIs to select the power mode that the flash memory operates in, and the number
 * of wait states to apply to flash operations.
 * @note Please note that this API provides only a small part of the features.
 *
 * @par Flash Power Modes
 *  The flash memory on the chip supports two power modes:
 *      - low power mode
 *      - high power mode \n
 *          High power mode may be required for some flash operations, please refer to the user manual for details.
 *      .
 * @warning Directly accessing Flash controller addresses (#NSS_FLASH_T) when the Flash clock is disabled blocks the
 *  APB bus indefinitely.
 *
 * @par Wait States
 *  To manage the flash memory read operation in low power mode, it may be necessary - dependent on the the system clock
 *  frequency - to wait for some number of extra system clocks, which is also called wait states. Please refer to the
 *  user manual for more details. For a full list of clock restrictions in effect, see @ref NSS_CLOCK_RESTRICTIONS.
 *
 * @par Erasing/Writing
 *  For flash erasing and writing, please refer to @ref IAP_NSS.
 *
 * @par Example - Switching between flash modes:
 *  Assume a controller that normally runs at 0.5MHz, but it can also run at 8MHz. When running on 8MHz, the
 *  flash should be either in high power mode(1), or in low power mode with extra wait states(2).
 *  -# Switch to 8MHz in low power mode with extra wait states
 *      @snippet flash_nss_example_1.c flash_nss_example_1_a
 *  -# Switch to 8MHz in high power mode without extra wait states
 *      @snippet flash_nss_example_1.c flash_nss_example_1_b
 *  .
