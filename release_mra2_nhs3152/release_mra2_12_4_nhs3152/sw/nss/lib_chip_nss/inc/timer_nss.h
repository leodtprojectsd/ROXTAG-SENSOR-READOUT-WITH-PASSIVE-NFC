 * @defgroup TIMER_NSS timer: 16/32-bit Timer driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * This driver provides APIs for the configuration and operation of both the 16-bit "CT16B" and 32-bit "CT32B"
 * counters/timers. The CT16B and CT32B HW blocks (16 and 32 bits timer/counter units) provide 16-bit and 32-bit
 * counters/timers function respectively.
 *
 * @par Introduction:
 *  This note describes the conceptual model of the timer hardware block. The timer hardware block has three extensions
 *  around its counter core: matching, external match control and pulse width modulation.
 *  Each of these are discussed next.
 *
 * @par Counter core:
 *  The core of the timer block is its counter. The counter register is called Timer Counter or TCR and is 32 bits
 *  (or 16 bits) wide. It is incremented when the prescaler of the timer expires, that is, when the Prescale Counter
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PC "PC" reaches the value in the Prescale Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PR "PR". The core has a fourth
 *  register, the Timer Control Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TCR "TCR",
 *  with two control bits: enabling counting respectively resetting (both @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" and
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PC "PC").

 *  The Prescale Counter @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PC "PC" counts cycles of the peripheral clock, which is the same as the
 *  system clock (towards the ARM).
 *
 * @par Matching:
 *  The first extension adds interrupt capabilities. There are 4 match registers @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0",
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR1", @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR2" and @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR3" that are
 *  continuously compared against the Timer Counter @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC". When the Timer Counter
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" matches @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MRx", several actions can be performed by the hardware:
 *      - generates an interrupt towards the @ref CMSIS_NVIC
 *      - resets the counter to 0 (via reset bit in @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TCR "TCR")
 *      - disables the counter (via enable bit in @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TCR "TCR")
 *      .
 *  The actions are programmed in the Match Control Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MCR "MCR". For each Match Register
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MRx", the Match Control Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MCR "MCR" has three bits MRxI, MRxR and MRxS
 *  that enable the actions Interrupt, Reset and Stop respectively. The Interrupt Register IR records which of the match
 *  registers caused the interrupt.

 *
 * @par External Match Control:
 *  The timer hardware block has output lines: MATx. As usual, those outputs are routed through the @ref IOCON_NSS to
 *  optionally connect them to external pins (typically with a function name CT32B_MATx or CT16B_MATx).
 *
 *  The External Match Control extension allows controlling the MATx outputs based on the match registers. When the
 *  Timer Counter @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" matches @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MRx", the following actions can be performed
 *  by the hardware:
 *      - not changing MATx
 *      - clearing MATx
 *      - setting MATx
 *      - toggling MATx
 *      .
 *  These actions are programmed in the External Match Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR". For each Match Register
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MRx", the @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" has a two bit External Match Control field EMCx with
 *  values:
 *      - 00b for not changing MATx
 *      - 01b for clearing MATx
 *      - 10b for setting MATx
 *      - and 11b for toggling MATx
 *      .
 *  Also note that the @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" has a one bit status field External Match EMx reflecting the state
 *  for each of the MATx outputs.

 *  @enddot
 *  The External Match Control extension has a limited implementation: MAT2 and MAT3 are not supported, and thus
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" does not have the EM2/EM3 status fields, nor the EMC2/EMC3 control fields.
 *
 *  Also note that there is only one MRx that can operate on MATx. As a result it is hard to implement PWM
 *  functionality: by programming EMCx to toggle we can make a 50% duty cycling signal on MATx. For better control use
 *  the Pulse Width Modulation feature of the timer.
 *
 * @par Pulse Width Modulation:
 *  Pulse Width Modulation PWM extension can drive the MATx registers instead of having the External Match Control
 *  extension drive the MATx pins. This is achieved by setting the PWM Enable bit PWMENx in the PWM Control register
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PWMC "PWMC".
 *
 *  The PWM extension drives MATx in a different way then the External Match Control extension. Basically,
 *  it starts by driving MATx low, until @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" reached MRx, then it drives MATx high. When the
 *  Matching extension issues a reset (via MCR.MRyR) of @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC", MATx is cleared again and the whole
 *  process repeats. So, with the PWM extension the duty cycle is controlled independently (MRx) from the frequency (MRy).
 *
 *  Note that the PWM extension has a limited implementation similar to the External Match Control extension:
 *  MAT2 and MAT3 are not supported, and thus @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PWMC "PWMC" does not have the PWMEN2/PWMEN3 control fields.
 *  Each block features:
 *      -# One 16/32-bit Timer Counter with a programmable 16/32-bit Prescaler
 *      -# Four 16/32-bit Match Registers that allow:
 *          - Continuous operation with optional interrupt generation on match
 *          - Stop timer on match with optional interrupt generation
 *          - Reset timer on match with optional interrupt generation
 *          .
 *      -# Up to two external outputs corresponding to the match registers with the following capabilities:
 *          - Set LOW on match
 *          - Set HIGH on match
 *          - Toggle on match
 *          - Do nothing on match
 *          - Single-edge controlled PWM outputs
 *          .
 *      .
 * @par Operation description of Timer Block:
 *  A Prescale Counter @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PC "PC" counts cycles of the peripheral clock and increments until it matches
 *  the Prescale Register @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PR "PR" value. On the next clock (i.e. NSS_TIMER_T.PR "PR" +1),
 *  the Timer Counter @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" is incremented and the @ref NSS_TIMER_T.PC "PC" resets to zero.
 *
 *  The @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" is then compared against each of the four Match Registers
 *  (@ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0, MR1, MR2, MR3"). When the value matches, the corresponding bits in Match Control Register
 *  @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MCR "MCR" and External Match Registers @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" registers determine the actions
 *  to be executed. Configurable actions on match can be a combination of the following:
 *      - Generate interrupt on match
 *      - Reset TC on match
 *      - Stop TC and PC on match
 *      - No action on match
 *      .
 *  Refer to timing chart in the user manual for detail.  Match registers can be independently set to generate interrupt
 *  on match, operate as configured by @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" or in PWM output mode.
 *
 *  The External Match Registers @ref NSS_TIMER_T.EMR "EMR" determines if a match of @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" and
 *  associated @ref NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MRn" shall either:
 *      - toggle
 *      - go LOW
 *      - go HIGH
 *      - do nothing with the External Match bits (EM0, EM1).
 *  For EM0 the @ref NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" is compared against NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0", and for EM1, the @ref
 *  NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" is compared against MR1. If the corresponding external match output pins are enabled, the
 *  EM0 state is reflected on the xxxxx_MAT0 output pin, while the EM1 state is reflected on the xxxxx_MAT1 output pin.
 *
 *  However, when the match output pins are configured as PWM output with #Chip_TIMER_SetMatchOutputMode, the function
 *  of the external match output pins are determined by single-edge controlled PWM mode.
 *  Up to two single-edge controlled PWM outputs can be selected on the xxxxx_MAT[0,1] outputs.
 *
 *  In PWM mode, PWM outputs go LOW at the beginning of each PWM cycle (timer is set to zero). PWM outputs goes HIGH
 *  when its match value is reached. The match register for PWM channel0 is NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0", while that for
 *  PWM channel1 is NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR1". One additional match register is necessary. This match register resets the
 *  timer, thus determines the PWM cycle length. When the timer is reset to zero, all currently HIGH PWM match outputs
 *  are cleared (LOW).
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Increment a 10ms timed SW counter:
 *  - NSS_TIMER_T.PR "PR" : SystemClock / 500 (500Hz, 2ms per tick)
 *  - NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0" : 1 (5x 2ms)
 *  - Interrupt and reset on match are enabled; Stop-on-match disabled
 *  .
 *
 *  @snippet timer_nss_example_1.c timer_nss_example_1
 *  Interrupt Handler:
 *  @snippet timer_nss_example_1.c timer_nss_example_1_irq
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Setup 50Hz, 50% duty-cycle External Match Output on 32-bit xxxxx_MAT0 output pin:
 *  Refer to user manual for actual pin names.
 *  - Prescale increment TC one tick every 2ms (500Hz)
 *  - NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" counts from 0 to 4 (10ms), matches NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0" and toggle xxxxx_MAT0 pin
 *      (Cycle Length is 20ms, or 50Hz output)
 *  - when NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" reaches 4, it resets to zero and repeats
 *  .
 *  @snippet timer_nss_example_2.c timer_nss_example_2
 *
 * @par Example 3 - Setup 2Hz PWM on both xxxxx_MAT0 and xxxxx_MAT1 output pins.
 *  Refer to user manual for actual pin names. PWMEN0 and PWMEN1 are enabled with NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR0" at 15/125
 *      (88% duty cycle), NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR1" at 75/125 (40% duty-cycle) and NSS_TIMER_T.MR "MR2"
 *      (with reset on match set) at 124.
 *  - xxxxx_MAT0 & xxxxx_MAT1 are both set LOW at start.
 *  - NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" counts until 15 and raise-HIGH xxxxx_MAT0
 *  - NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" continue counting until 75 and raise-HIGH xxxxx_MAT1, and
 *  - when NSS_TIMER_T.TC "TC" reaches 124, both xxxxx_MAT0 and xxxxx_MAT1 are set low, TC reset to zero and repeats
 *  .
