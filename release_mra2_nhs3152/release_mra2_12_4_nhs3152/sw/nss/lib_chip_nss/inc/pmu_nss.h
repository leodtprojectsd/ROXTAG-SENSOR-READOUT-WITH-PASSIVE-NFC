/**
 * @defgroup PMU_NSS pmu: Power Management Unit driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Power Management Unit driver (PMU) provides the API to control all the functionalities handled by the PMU HW
 * block. The PMU driver allows controlling the:
 *  -# Power modes
 *  -# Power switches
 *  -# Brown-Out detector
 *  -# NFC power detector
 *  -# Wakeup pin functionality
 *  -# RTC block clock source
 *  .
 *
 * @anchor pmu_powerarch_anchor
 * @par Power Architecture:
 *  The chip has 4 separate major power domains:
 *      - NFC (VNFC)
 *      - Always-On (VDD_ALON)
 *      - 1.2V Internal (VDD1V2)
 *      - 1.6V Internal (VDD1V6)
 *      .
 *  Power may be supplied via two possible sources:
 *      - External power supply pin (VDDBAT)
 *      - Built-in RFID rectifier (part of the VNFC power domain)
 *      .
 *  The VDD_ALON power domain is directly powered by one of these two power sources. The PMU, which is in the VDD_ALON
 *  power domain, is responsible for controlling the power for the 1V2 and 1V6 internal power domains.
 *
 * @par
 *  Both the VDDBAT pin and the VNFC power sources are connected to the VDD_ALON power domain by means of automatic
 *  switches. The switches define which power source is providing power to the VDD_ALON power domain and, consequently,
 *  the rest of the chip. The switches are, thus, never closed simultaneously.
 *
 * @par
 *  Even when power in the VDDBAT pin is present (when voltage is lower than 1.72V, power is not considered to be
 *  present), the respective switch will only be automatically closed when the RESETN pin is deasserted (an edge from
 *  low to high is detected) or at the time power is detected at the VNFC power domain (an edge from no power detected
 *  to power detected coming from the built-in RFID rectifier). In other words, even when power in the VDDBAT pin is
 *  present, the chip is only effectively powered up when one of these two triggers is detected. This switch can be
 *  manually set back to its initial open state using the #Chip_PMU_Switch_OpenVDDBat function.
 *
 * @par
 *  When power in the VNFC domain becomes present (when voltage is lower than 1.72V, power is not considered to be
 *  present), there are three possible scenarios:
 *      - No power is available in the VDDBAT pin
 *      - Power is also available in the VDDBAT pin, but the switch is still open
 *      - Power is also available in the VDDBAT pin, but the switch is already closed
 *      .
 *  In the first scenario, the VNFC switch is automatically closed and the chip will be powered via VNFC. @n
 *  In the second scenario, the presence of VNFC will trigger the VDDBAT switch to close. In the presence of the two
 *  power sources, the automatic switching mechanism will give priority to VDDBAT. @n
 *  In the last scenario, as the switch is already closed, the IC is already being powered by the VDDBAT pin. Hence,
 *  when VNFC becomes also present, priority will continue to be given to VDDBAT. @n
 *  As described above, it is always possible to manually send back the VDDBAT switch to its initial open state using
 *  the #Chip_PMU_Switch_OpenVDDBat function. This can be used to manually trigger a switchover from VDDBAT to VNFC
 *  power source. So it is possible to force the IC to be powered by VNFC, however this has to be done each time power
 *  in the VNFC domain becomes present.
 *
 * @par
 *  Switchover from one source to the other is automatically done in both directions without glitches in the VDD_ALON
 *  power domain.
 *
 * @par
 *  The VDD_ALON power domain is hard connected to the external bondpad ring (pins), hence, it is possible to provide
 *  power to the pins from both VDDBAT or VNFC. Note that in the latter case, the VDDBAT pin will be disconnected from
 *  the bondpad ring as it is only meant to be a power source itself.
 *
 * @par Power Modes:
 *  <dl><dt> Active: </dt><dd>
 *      This is the default power state after Power-On-Reset. In this state, all internal power domains (1V2 and 1V6)
 *      are powered. Thus, the ARM core and memories are clocked by the system clock, and peripherals are clocked (if
 *      enabled) by the system clock or a dedicated peripheral clock. </dd>
 *  <dt> Sleep: </dt><dd>
 *      The only difference from Active to Sleep is that the clocking of the ARM core is stopped and program execution
 *      is suspended until an interrupt reaches the core or a reset condition is detected. All peripherals, if in use,
 *      continue operation, the processor state and registers as well as SRAM content are retained and the logic levels
 *      of pins remain static. Use the #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterSleep function to enter the Sleep power mode after the
 *      wake-up interrupt sources are correctly configured. </dd>
 *  <dt> Deep Sleep: </dt><dd>
 *      In this power mode, as in Sleep mode, the clocking of the ARM core is also stopped . Moreover, all analog
 *      peripherals and Flash memory are powered down. However, as the SFRO keeps running, it is possible to leave the
 *      Watchdog timer or the general-purpose timers running (if required for timer controlled wake-up). The processor
 *      state and registers as well as SRAM content are retained and the logic levels of pins remain static. Use
 *      #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepSleep to enter the Deep Sleep power mode after the wake-up interrupt source are
 *      correctly configured and all the peripheral clocks, except the ones required, are disabled. @n
 *      The chip can exit the Deep Sleep power mode and resume execution on any Start Logic or Watchdog interrupt or
 *      restart execution in Active mode on a reset condition. </dd>
 *  @anchor pmu_deeppowerdownmode_anchor
 *  <dt> Deep power down: </dt><dd>
 *      In this power mode, all the internal power domains (1V2 and 1V6) are switched off (SFRO is stopped).
 *      In other words, everything is powered down except the VDD_ALON power domain (PMU and RTC are still powered).
 *      This means that, besides the program execution and peripherals being stopped and the ARM core state being lost,
 *      all SRAM and register content is also lost (except registers residing in the PMU and RTC). All digital
 *      functional pins are tri-stated except for the WAKEUP (if previously configured), and RESETN pins. Use the
 *      #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown function to enter the Deep power down power mode after the wake-up
 *      sources are correctly configured. @n
 *      The chip can exit the Deep power down power mode on a reset condition, WAKEUP pin asserted (active low), RTC
 *      wake-up counter expire event or NFC powered event (NVIC or ARM core not involved). After waking up from Deep
 *      Power Down mode, the code execution is restarted (never resumed). If the chip exits Deep power down mode due to
 *      a reset condition, all the registers from the PMU and RTC are also set to their default value, including RTC
 *      counters, PMU general purpose registers and status flags. @n
 *      Using the #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_GetDPDWakeupReason function it is possible to know if the chip woke up from Deep
 *      Power Down as well as the reason for the wake up. @n
 *      Note that, if there is a debugging session ongoing when you enter Deep power down mode, it will terminate and
 *      cannot be started again as long as the IC is in Deep power down mode. @n
 *      More important details when combining the wakeup functionality with the use of the Deep power down mode can
 *      found below: see @ref pmu_deeppowerdownprocedure_anchor "Deep power down procedure".</dd>
 *  @anchor pmu_poweroffmode_anchor
 *  <dt> Off: </dt><dd>
 *      In this "Off" mode, it is considered that power is present in the VDDBAT pin. In this mode everything in the IC
 *      is powered off except the HW logic that detects the triggers that cause the VDDBAT switch to close and
 *      consequently power the rest of the IC (see @ref pmu_powerarch_anchor "Power Architecture"). @n
 *      Use the #Chip_PMU_Switch_OpenVDDBat function to enter the "Off" mode. When the "Off" mode is left (due to RESETN
 *      asserted or power present in VNFC), the IC will start-up from scratch (POR). </dd></dl>
 *  Regardless of the power mode ("Off" is not included), RTC and PMU register values will be kept and functionality
 *  ensured until a full system reset occurs which sets all registers to their default state. A normal exit from Deep
 *  Power Down mode does not trigger a full system reset.
 *
 * @anchor pmu_power_source_switches_par
 * @par Power source switches:
 *  Each power source (VDDBAT pin and VNFC power domain) has a dedicated switch that connects it to the VDD_ALON power
 *  domain. These switches behave automatically, and give priority to the VDDBAT pin, as described above. @n
 *  The state of the switches can be individually checked using the #Chip_PMU_Switch_GetVNFC and the
 *  #Chip_PMU_Switch_GetVDDBat functions.
 *  This automatic switching mechanism can be disabled before entering Deep power down
 *  (See #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown).
 *  This is typically done to keep power consumption to a minimum, however, special care must be taken when entering
 *  Deep power down with the power source switches disabled when running from an almost empty battery (VDDBat ~ 1.74V).
 *  The consequences are that if the battery drains out (VDDBat < 1.74V) during Deep power down and the automatic
 *  switching mechanism is disabled, the IC won't be able to switch to VNFC power and start execution using the energy
 *  of an NFC field only. @n
 *  The proposed solution is to use the Brown Out detector feature of the IC (See @ref pmu_brown_out_detector_par
 *  "Brown-Out-Detector") to find out if VDDBat is below 1.8V to decide whether or not it is safe to disable the
 *  automatic switching mechanism.
 *
 * @anchor pmu_brown_out_detector_par
 * @par Brown-Out-Detector:
 *  The PMU provides the possibility to monitor the power source voltage and detect whether it drops to 1.8V or below.
 *  This functionality is disabled by default and can be enabled using the #Chip_PMU_SetBODEnabled function. The
 *  detection of a Brown-Out condition is combined with interrupt generation. The current state of the BOD can be
 *  checked with the #Chip_PMU_GetStatus function and the interrupt generation can be enabled with
 *  #Chip_PMU_Int_SetEnabledMask. If enabled, the BOD functionality will be working during all power modes, although its
 *  interrupt can only be used as a wake-up source in Sleep mode. The occurrence of a BO condition can, thus, only be
 *  known after wakeup from Sleep, Deep Sleep or Deep power down. @n
 *  Note that the #Chip_PMU_GetStatus function will not provide the BOD interrupt flag that retains its value after
 *  triggered, but only the current status of the BOD (if the brown out condition is not present anymore, the current
 *  status will be cleared). To get the BOD interrupt flag, use the #Chip_PMU_Int_GetRawStatus function.
 *
 * @par NFC power detector:
 *  The PMU provides the possibility to detect, in SW, the presence of power in the VNFC power domain. This
 *  functionality is always enabled and the current status of the power in the VNFC power domain can be checked using
 *  #Chip_PMU_GetStatus. The respective interrupt generation can be enabled with the #Chip_PMU_Int_SetEnabledMask
 *  function. @n
 *  The NFC power detector functionality will be working during all power modes, although its interrupt can only be used
 *  as a wake-up source in Sleep mode (via triggering of corresponding interrupt in the NVIC). To wake-up from Deep
 *  Sleep with an NFC field, you can use the respective start logic interrupt (see
 *  @ref startLogic_anchor "System wake-up start logic"). @n
 *  Note that the #Chip_PMU_GetStatus function will not provide the VNFC power interrupt flag that retains its value
 *  after triggered, but only the current status of the VNFC power (if the VNFC power is not present anymore, the
 *  current status will be cleared). To get the VNFC power interrupt flag, use the #Chip_PMU_Int_GetRawStatus function.
 *  @note It is not possible to reliably detect whether the power-off mode has been left due to power present in VNFC.
 *      As mentioned, you can get the current status using #Chip_PMU_GetStatus but this will not tell you whether the
 *      VDDBAT pin got connected and the IC started up due to the presence of an NFC field: it is possible that the
 *      NFC field triggers VDDBAT pin to be connected but is already gone by the time #Chip_PMU_GetStatus is called; or
 *      that the field was only present after VDDBAT pin got connected (due to a different reason) but just in time for
 *      the #Chip_PMU_GetStatus call.
 *
 * @par Wakeup Pin:
 *  The PMU provides the possibility to wakeup from Deep power down mode when a high-to-low transition in the PIO0_0 pin
 *  is detected. By default, after a reset, this functionality is disabled, meaning it is not possible to exit the
 *  Deep power down mode via the PIO0_0 pin. To enable this functionality, the application must:
 *  - Call #Chip_PMU_SetWakeupPinEnabled with @c true as argument, and
 *  - Configure the PIO0_0 pin for input with the pull-up resistor enabled.
 *  .
 *
 * @par General Purpose data registers:
 *  The PMU can hold 5 words of data in its own registers which is retained during Deep power down mode. This data will
 *  only be lost after a Power-On-Reset or an external reset (RESETN pin asserted). This data region can be accessed
 *  using #Chip_PMU_SetRetainedData and #Chip_PMU_GetRetainedData. This data section is available to be used by the
 *  application layer as a simple data container to store data that needs to survive a Deep power down.
 *
 * @anchor pmu_syncwait_warning_anchor
 * @warning Each PMU block register read and write performs at least one "wait" period that may take up to 100us to
 *  complete due to hardware synchronization within the module. @b All the functions in this driver make at least one
 *  such register access. Impact on performance should be carefully considered especially when calling PMU driver
 *  functions in ISRs context and high-priority threads. If a PMU block register read/write preempts
 *  another PMU block register read/write, the procedure is repeated until no preemption is detected, which leads to
 *  additional "wait" period, and thus delays.
 *
 * @anchor pmu_deeppowerdownprocedure_anchor
 * @par Deep power down procedure:
 *  Entering Deep power down mode requires register changes in both #NSS_PMU_T.PCON and ARM's SCB.SCR register.
 *  The function #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown abstracts away the necessary register changes. @n
 *  When the wakeup pin functionality is enabled - using #Chip_PMU_SetWakeupPinEnabled - correct usage of the Deep
 *  power down mode requires more involvement from the application. Entering the low power mode can fail, dependent on
 *  the state of the WAKEUP pin when the call is made, and the application code must take this possibility into account.
 *  - In case the WAKEUP pin is high, the digital part of the PMU has no problems transitioning to the different
 *      internal states, and will arrive at the request Deep power down mode. Code will not be resumed.
 *  - In case the wakeup pin low, the desired state cannot be entered.
 *      Instead, the processor will go to Sleep (the Sleep Deep mode) with the IC @b not going to Deep Power Down
 *      (nor to Deep Sleep). The Deep power down request is not cleared however, but kept pending.
 *      The pending request is continually re-checked at the rate of the TFRO, i.e. at 32 kHz. @n
 *      When an interrupt arrives, the ARM core will clear the sleep signal. This happens independently from the
 *      sampling of the wakeup pin. There are two possible outcomes at the next re-check of the pending request:
 *      - Either the sleep signal has been cleared, or the wakeup pin is still low.
 *          In that case, Deep power down mode is @b not entered. Instead, code execution resumes. @n
 *          The function #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown @b will return. The function implementation ensures
 *          the pending Deep power down request has been cleared before it returns.
 *      - Otherwise, if both the sleep signal has not yet been cleared and the wakeup pin is high again,
 *          Deep power down mode is entered belatedly.
 *      .
 *  .
 *  Unfortunately, this leads to an increased code complexity for the application, as it must implement a code flow
 *  that can deal with the different outcomes. Applications using both the Deep power down mode @em and the wakeup pin
 *  functionality should follow the below recommendations.
 *  - Wrap the complete code flow from reset to Deep power down in a loop (line 3). In case
 *      #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown (line 9) returns, this will ensure that correct code can run.
 *  - Inside each loop, always check whether the wakeup pin is low, and act correspondingly (lines 2, 5, 7).
 *      This will ensure that a second attempt to enter the Deep power down mode, at the end of the second section of
 *      the loop, now has a bigger chance to succeed.
 *  - Before calling #Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown, start a timer which generates an interrupt after a short
 *      interval, and enable the interrupt (line 8). This will ensure that only a very short amount of time is lost in
 *      the more expensive Sleep mode (when compared to the current consumption in Deep power down).
 *  .
 *  Combining all this results in a recommended basic application framework similar to this pseudo code:
 *  @code
 *       1. Board_Init();
 *       2. store cause of wakeup in local variable
 *       3. for(;;) {
 *       4.    initialize drivers and modules
 *       5.    perform requested tasks, per the local variable's value
 *       6.    de-initialize drivers and modules
 *       7.    reset local variable to WAKEUP
 *       8.    start a timer, enabling its interrupt, and implementing a (dummy) interrupt handler.
 *       9.    Chip_PMU_PowerMode_EnterDeepPowerDown(true or false);
 *      10. }
