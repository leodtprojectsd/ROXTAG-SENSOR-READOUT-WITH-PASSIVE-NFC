/**
 * @defgroup RTC_NSS rtc: Real-Time Clock driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Real-Time Clock (RTC) module has two main features:
 *  <dl><dt> Time up-counter </dt>
 *      <dd>This records the time (e.g. seconds since epoch, which can be converted in year/month/day,
 *      hour/minute/second).</dd>
 *  <dt> Wake-up down-counter </dt>
 *      <dd>This counter counts down to zero and can 'wake-up' the chip from standby modes: Sleep, Deep Sleep and
 *      Deep Power Down.</dd></dl>
 *
 * Both the counters step on a "tick". A tick consists of a number of TFRO pulses.
 * The TFRO is calibrated during production to run at about 32768 Hz on reset, one tick is typically about 32768 TFRO
 * pulses and thus 1 second. The exact number of TFRO clocks to make 1 second is loaded during boot time and stored in
 * the RTCCAL register.
 * Both the TFRO oscillator and the RTC HW block are part of the always-on power domain.
 *
 * @par Time up-counter
 *  As soon as the TFRO is connected, the up-counter starts incrementing. This happens independently from the power mode
 *  and the ARM state.
 *  See @ref PMU_NSS for details on TFRO configuration.
 *
 * @par Wake-up down-counter
 *  The down-counter is by default disabled. It needs to be explicitly enabled and started in order to count.
 *  When active, the counter counts down, independently from the power mode and the ARM state. When the down-counter
 *  reaches zero, a wake-up event is generated. This allows the chip to 'wake-up' from Sleep, Deep Sleep, and
 *  Deep Power Down.
 *
 * @par
 *  In Deep Power Down mode, the IC will wake up unconditionally when the down-counter reaches zero. It is not required
 *  to configure the NVIC and or any other start logic for waking up from the Deep Power Down mode.
 *  A reset signal is generated and a full boot process is run. SW execution is @em not resumed, and no interrupt
 *  function is called. The application can instead check at startup whether the #PMU_DPD_WAKEUPREASON_RTC flag is set.
 *
 * @par
 *  In other modes (Active, Sleep, Deep Sleep), when the down-counter reaches zero, an RTC interrupt is generated that
 *  forks to two slots in the NVIC: the standard RTC peripheral interrupt #RTC_IRQn and the secondary interrupt
 *  #RTCPWREQ_IRQn via Start Logic. @n
 *  See @ref CMSIS_Core_NVICFunctions "NVIC API" and @ref startLogic_anchor "System wake-up start logic" for more
 *  details.
 *
 * @note There can be other 'wake-up' reasons from various standby modes. See @ref PMU_NSS for details.
 *
 * @par In order to operate the RTC module
 *  - up-counter:
 *      #Chip_RTC_Time_GetValue and #Chip_RTC_Time_SetValue provide R/W access.
 *  - down-counter:
 *      -# Use #Chip_RTC_Wakeup_SetControl to operate the down-counter.
 *      -# Use #Chip_RTC_Wakeup_SetReload to configure the down-counter.
 *      -# Set #RTC_INT_WAKEUP with #Chip_RTC_Int_SetEnabledMask to enable
 *      -# Additional steps are necessary to operate the down-counter function with various states of standby.
 *          See the examples below.
 *      .
 *  .
 *
 * @anchor RTC_WARNING
 * @warning Each RTC block register read and write action requires at least one @c wait period. A single wait period
 *  can take up to 100us to complete due to hardware synchronization within the module.
 *  All functions in this driver make at least one such register access unless stated otherwise. This impacts
 *  performance and should be taken into account, especially when calling RTC driver functions in an interrupt context.
 *  If an RTC block register read/write preempts another RTC block register read/write, the procedure is repeated
 *  leading to another @c wait period, until no preemption is detected.
 *
 * @par Example 1 - RTC down-counter: wake-up from Sleep Mode
 *  @n Initialization (once):
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_1.c rtc_nss_example_1
 *  @n Activation:
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_1.c rtc_nss_example_1_b
 *  @n RTC interrupt handling:
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_1.c rtc_nss_example_1_irq
 *  @n
 *
 * @par Example 2 - RTC down-counter: wake-up from Deep Sleep Mode, and manual start.
 *  This example is using @ref startLogic_anchor "System wake-up start logic" @n
 *  @n Initialization (once):
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_2.c rtc_nss_example_2
 *  @n Activation:
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_2.c rtc_nss_example_2_b
 *  @n RTC interrupt handling:
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_2.c rtc_nss_example_2_irq
 *  @n
 *
 * @par Example 3 - RTC "wake-up down-counter" with Deep Power Down Mode
 *  @n Initialization (once):
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_3.c rtc_nss_example_3
 *  @n Activation:
 *  @snippet rtc_nss_example_3.c rtc_nss_example_3_b
 *  @n RTC interrupt service routine will not be called as NVIC is not active during Deep Power Down mode.
