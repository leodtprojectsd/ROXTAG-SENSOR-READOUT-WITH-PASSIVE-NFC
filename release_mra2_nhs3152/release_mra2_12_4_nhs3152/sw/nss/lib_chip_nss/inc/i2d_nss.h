/** @defgroup I2D_NSS i2d: Current to Digital converter driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Current to Digital converter (I2D) driver provides the API to control all the functionalities
 * of the Current to Digital HW block.@n
 * The I2D block allows measuring and converting the current flowing through a given analog pin into a digital value.
 * The current sink/source is connected to the I2D converter by means of a Mux.
 * The block is composed of a current scaler with configurable input gain followed by a converter (I/F converter)
 * with configurable integration time and internal gain.
 *
 * @par Mux
 *  The I2D converter Mux allows connecting the external analog pins and the internal bus lines to the I2D converter.
 *  It is allowed to select more than one input simultaneously.
 *
 * @par Current Scaler
 *  This element will divide/multiply the current input. It is possible to select several modes for the scaler and even
 *  to bypass it, connecting the current input directly to the converter. In this last case, a bias voltage of 1.1V
 *  is seen at the input multiplexer and thus the I2D block becomes a current source. Logically, when the scaler is
 *  not bypassed, the bias voltage is 0 and the I2D behaves as a current sink. Please refer to #I2D_SCALER_GAIN_T for
 *  all the supported scaler modes.
 *
 * @par I/F Converter
 *  The actual converter, takes a certain current input and converts it into a frequency signal. This signal consists on
 *  a number of pulses with a frequency proportional to the current. These pulses are then counted during a certain
 *  integration time. The total number of pulses counted over the integration time is the actual digital value that
 *  comes out of the conversion process.
 *  The maximum current that the converter is able to handle (saturation) is determined by the maximum number of pulses
 *  that can be outputted in the frequency signal and by the converter internal gain. The maximum frequency is 1 pulse
 *  every 2us which corresponds to a maximum current of 2.5uA, with #I2D_CONVERTER_GAIN_LOW selected, or 50nA with
 *  #I2D_CONVERTER_GAIN_HIGH selected (High gain is 50x higher than low gain).
 *  The conversion integration time is also configurable and will affect the resolution of the calculated absolute
 *  current. The shorter the integration time, the less pulses are counted (for the same input current) and the less
 *  bits will the resultant digital value use. The optimal integration time must match the maximum frequency of the
 *  converted signal with the maximum bit depth of the counter (16bit). Thus, at 1 pulse every 4 us, it takes
 *  262.14 ms of integration time to reach 65535 pulses.
 *
 * Additionally, the block supports configuration of single shot or continuous mode and even interrupts when conversion
 * is completed or outside a configured window. The native output of the I2D block is a bit density and there are
 * functions to convert a native conversion result to an absolute current value in pico Ampere and back
 * (#Chip_I2D_PicoAmpereToNative and #Chip_I2D_NativeToPicoAmpere).
 * The resolution of the absolute current value is affected by the converter integration time.
 *
 * @par Converter State Description
 *  -# The I2D converter follows a simple 2 state (Idle <-> In Operation) approach.
 *      After the driver is initialized (#Chip_I2D_Init) it is ensured to be in the "Idle" state. All the converter
 *      settings shall be done in this state. The status information for the I2D converter can be read at any time
 *      with the #Chip_I2D_ReadStatus function.
 *
 *  -# The transition to the "In Operation" state is triggered with the #Chip_I2D_Start function. During this transition,
 *      the settings loaded during the "Idle" state will be used and the conversion will start in the required
 *      mode (#I2D_MODE_T). Calling the #Chip_I2D_Start function in the "In Operation" state will not affect
 *      the ongoing conversion.
 *
 *  -# Depending on the selected operating mode, the transition back to "Idle" state works differently:\n
 *      - In case #I2D_CONTINUOUS mode is selected, the converter will automatically start a new conversion at the end
 *          of each one and stay in the "In operation" state. Calling the #Chip_I2D_Stop function will trigger the
 *          converter to transition to "Idle" state once the ongoing conversion ends.
 *      - In case #I2D_SINGLE_SHOT mode is selected, the transition to "Idle" state is done automatically after
 *          the first conversion is completed.
 *      .
 *      As long as the converter is in the "In Operation" state, the #I2D_STATUS_CONVERTER_IN_OPERATION status flag is set.
 *
 *  -# Regardless of the operating mode and converter state, at the end of each conversion, the
 *      #I2D_STATUS_CONVERSION_DONE status flag is set, the converted result is available for read
 *      (using #Chip_I2D_GetValue), and the remaining status flags (#I2D_STATUS_RANGE_TOO_LOW and
 *      #I2D_STATUS_RANGE_TOO_HIGH) that provide further information regarding the conversion are set when applicable.
 *      Logically, both the value and the #I2D_STATUS_RANGE_TOO_LOW / #I2D_STATUS_RANGE_TOO_HIGH information of
 *      a certain conversion are lost when the next conversion ends.
 *      Additionally, once the conversion result is read (using #Chip_I2D_GetValue), the #I2D_INT_CONVERSION_RDY
 *      interrupt flag and consequently the #I2D_STATUS_CONVERSION_DONE status flag are automatically cleared.
 *  .
 *
 * @par In order to perform a conversion
 *  -# Initialize the I2D converter block with default settings with #Chip_I2D_Init.
 *  -# If required, change operating mode, scaler gain, converter gain or converter integration time with,
 *      respectively, #Chip_I2D_SetMode, #Chip_I2D_SetScalerGain, #Chip_I2D_SetConverterGain
 *      or #Chip_I2D_SetConverterIntegrationTime, or alternatively with #Chip_I2D_Setup to change all parameters at once.
 *  -# Connect the required inputs via the Mux (using #I2D_INPUT_T enum values) to the I2D converter
 *      with #Chip_I2D_SetMuxInput.
 *  -# Start a conversion with #Chip_I2D_Start.
 *  -# Wait for the conversion to be ready (assess that with #Chip_I2D_ReadStatus).
 *  -# Read the converted value with #Chip_I2D_GetValue.
 *  -# If performing a #I2D_CONTINUOUS conversion, stop it with #Chip_I2D_Stop.
 *  .
 *
 * @note The status information of the I2D converter can be read with #Chip_I2D_ReadStatus.
 * @note Interrupts on threshold crossing (low and high) as well as on every conversion can be set up and handled with
 *  Chip_I2D_Int_* functions.
 * @note The interrupt service routine, when needed, must be implemented in the scope of the application code.
 * @note The native bit density value (outputted by the #Chip_I2D_GetValue function) from the I2D converter
 *  can be converted to an absolute current in pico ampere with #Chip_I2D_NativeToPicoAmpere and back with
 *  #Chip_I2D_PicoAmpereToNative. Please note that the accuracy of the absolute current value is limited. Refer to
 *  User Manual for more information on the absolute current accuracy.
