/** @defgroup WWDT_NSS wwdt: Windowed Watchdog Timer driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * This driver provides a simplified API to the WWDT hardware block. The WWDT driver provides the following
 * functionalities:
 *  - Configuring the block in reset mode.
 *  - Configuring the expiry timeout.
 *  - Starting the watchdog timer.
 *  - Feeding the watchdog timer.
 *  .
 *  If you require interrupt mode, need to check the status, or need to do anything else than described above,
 *  you must interact with the #NSS_WWDT register block directly.
 *
 * The WWDT hardware block controls a special timer which can perform a configured action on expiry. This can
 * be used to recover from an anomaly in software: for example an infinite loop or an endless wait for an event or
 * interrupt.
 * The WWDT can be configured to work in 2 modes as given below.
 *  - Reset mode: This mode is the normal intended operation mode and causes an unpreventable chip reset on WWDT expiry.
 *  .
 *      @warning The watchdog reset status is cleared on system reset. It is thus not possible to distinguish between a
 *          hard reset after toggling the RESETN pin and a WWDT timeout.
 *
 *  - Interrupt mode: This mode can be used for debugging purposes without actually resetting the device on WWDT expiry.
 *      The WWDT interrupt flag cannot be cleared by SW after a WWDT expiry: the firmware must disable the WWDT
 *      interrupt inside the interrupt handler using #NVIC_DisableIRQ with #WDT_IRQn as argument.
 *  .
 *      @note This mode is not supported by this driver.
 *      @warning Using the interrupt mode will not protect against hangs inside an interrupt handler which has a higher
 *          priority. See #IRQn_Type for a full list of interrupts and their priority.
 *
 * @par To configure and start the WWDT:
 *  -# Call #Chip_WWDT_Start.
 *  .
 *
 * @par To reset the expiry timer and prevent a reset:
 *  -# Call #Chip_WWDT_Feed periodically.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Example - WWDT
 *  @snippet wwdt_nss_example_1.c wwdt_nss_example_1
