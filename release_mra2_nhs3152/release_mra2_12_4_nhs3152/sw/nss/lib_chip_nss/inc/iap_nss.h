/**
 * @defgroup IAP_NSS iap: In Application Programming driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The In Application Programming driver (IAP) API implements a wrapper for the actual code which is in ROM, and which
 * is exposed via the binary IAP interface. The driver exposes the following features:
 *  -# Read factory settings.
 *  -# Prepare (unprotect) sectors for flash erase/program operations.
 *  -# Erase flash sectors.
 *  -# Erase flash pages.
 *  -# Copy the data from RAM/EEPROM and write to flash.
 *  -# Perform blank checking of the flash sectors.
 *  -# Read Part Identification.
 *  -# Read boot code version.
 *  -# Read UID (Unique Identification) which is the device serial number.
 *  -# Perform comparison of two memory spaces.
 *  .
 * The "Prepare" command will unprotect the sectors, and upon success execution of the flash operations
 * including sector erase, page erase, and program commands, the touched sectors will be protected automatically.
 *
 * @warning To erase/program the flash, the system clock must be set to a clock frequency of minimum 125kHz.
 *
 * @see Please refer to the chapter "In Application Programming Firmware" of the User Manual
 *  for details on the IAP interface.
 *
 * @warning During an erase or program operation, the flash is not accessible, hence if the Interrupt Vector Table
 *  is placed in Flash (default setup) the application should make sure that no interrupts are triggered.
 *  To disable all interrupts please refer to #__disable_irq(void).
 *
 * @par Example1 - Erase flash sector 10 and write 4 pages (e.g. 64 bytes per page)
 *  of data to the start address of sector 10
 *  - Data : stored in ram buffer "buffer[256]"
 *  - Flash address : start address of sector 10. (Since each sector contain 16 pages, the first page in sector 10 is
 *      10 * 16 = 160. Since sectors are 1024 bytes, the start address of sector 10 is 10 * 1024 = 10240.)
 *  - System clock : 8 MHz
 *  .
 *  @snippet iap_nss_example_1.c iap_nss_example_1
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Load RTC factory calibration value into RTC
 *  @snippet iap_nss_example_2.c iap_nss_example_2
 *
 * @par Example 3 - Read Part ID, boot version & UID
 *  @snippet iap_nss_example_3.c iap_nss_example_3

 *  - User needs to ensure that the region of the page to be written is previously erased (all 0xFFs)
 *  - User needs to ensure that the region of the page to be left untouched is overwritten with the same data or with
 *      all 0xFFs

 *      written more than once after erasing)

 *      -# Erase page (content is FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF ... FFFFFFFF)
 *      -# Write first word 0x01234567 by writing "01234567 FFFFFFFF ... FFFFFFFF"
