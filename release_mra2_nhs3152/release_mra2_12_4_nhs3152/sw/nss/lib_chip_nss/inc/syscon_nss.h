/** @defgroup SYSCON_NSS syscon: System Configuration driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The System Configuration driver (SYSCON) provides the API to control most of the functionalities handled by the
 * SYSCON HW block. There is an exception for the handling of clocks, which is covered in a separate Clock driver.@n
 * The SYSCON driver allows:
 *  -# Remapping the Interrupt Vector Table location
 *  -# Controlling the reset lines and power for some peripherals
 *  -# Accessing the System Reset status
 *  -# Controlling the system wake-up start logic and state
 *  -# Reading the device ID
 *  .
 *
 * @par Interrupt Vector Table Remap
 *  By default, after booting, the ARM core Interrupt Vector Table is located in Flash at address 0x0. However, using
 *  the #Chip_SysCon_IVT_SetAddress function it is possible to remap it to any SRAM or Flash location. When remapping
 *  the Interrupt Vector Table, ensure that the configured address places the vector table aligned and in the existing
 *  memories. Note that the two highest sectors of the Flash memory (last 2kB) are reserved.
 *
 * @par Peripheral reset and power control
 *  Using the #Chip_SysCon_Peripheral_AssertReset/#Chip_SysCon_Peripheral_DeassertReset functions is possible to
 *  assert/de-assert the reset line of the peripherals defined in #SYSCON_PERIPHERAL_RESET_T. All the peripherals have
 *  their reset lines asserted by default, except the EEPROM controller.
 *  Using the #Chip_SysCon_Peripheral_EnablePower/#Chip_SysCon_Peripheral_DisablePower functions it is possible to
 *  enable/disable the power of the peripherals included in #SYSCON_PERIPHERAL_POWER_T. All the peripherals are powered
 *  down by default, except the Flash memory.
 *  Note that when the Flash memory is powered down, it must be ensured that both the Interrupt Vector Table and the
 *  program code is executed from SRAM.
 *
 * @par System Reset status
 *  The source of the last reset may be known by using the #Chip_SysCon_Reset_GetSource function. Note that the reset
 *  sources are retained after an ARM core reset and they are only cleared on a full system reset or by calling
 *  #Chip_SysCon_Reset_ClearSource.
 *  In order to always get only the last reset source, #Chip_SysCon_Reset_ClearSource shall be always called after the
 *  reset source is retrieved. All reset sources cause a full system reset except the #SYSCON_RESETSOURCE_SOFTWARE,
 *  which only causes an ARM core reset.
 *
 * @anchor startLogic_anchor
 * @par System wake-up start logic
 *  The Start Logic mechanism consists of a group of internal logical lines that, once enabled and asserted, issue a
 *  start signal that triggers the ARM core to wake up from Deep-Sleep mode (see PMU documentation for more details on
 *  Power Modes).
 *  Each startup logic line is also connected to a separate wake-up interrupt handler in the NVIC (in the same order,
 *  from #PIO0_0_IRQn to #RTCPWREQ_IRQn). The interrupt(s) corresponding to each start logic source must be enabled in
 *  the NVIC so that they can interrupt the ARM core and actually trigger the wake-up (these interrupt lines are
 *  prepared to work without a system clock). Although the start logic is designed to be functional during Deep-Sleep,
 *  it can also be used during Active or Sleep modes to generate normal interrupts on rising or falling edges of the
 *  GPIO pins.
 *  The #SYSCON_STARTSOURCE_T defines all the available sources that are connected to an internal start logic line and
 *  thus can trigger an ARM core wake up from Deep-Sleep.
 *  As in normal interrupt logic, each line can be individually:
 *      - enabled using the #Chip_SysCon_StartLogic_SetEnabledMask function;
 *      - checked for status using the #Chip_SysCon_StartLogic_GetStatus function; and
 *      - cleared using the #Chip_SysCon_StartLogic_ClearStatus function
 *      .
 *  Additionally, for each Digital IO pin source, using the #Chip_SysCon_StartLogic_SetPIORisingEdge function it can be
 *  configured which transition edge of the pin causes the respective start signal to be asserted.
 *  The state of the Start Logic lines indicates if the wake-up signal to the ARM core is triggered. Thus, before
 *  entering the Deep-Sleep mode, it must be ensured that all the Start Logic lines are cleared.
 *  All start logic lines are disabled by default.
 *
 * @par Device ID
 *  The Device ID of the chip can be retrieved using the #Chip_SysCon_GetDeviceID.
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Initialize/De-initialize peripherals
 *  Peripherals:
 *      - I2C0 (Digital)
 *      - I2D (Analog)
 *      .
 *  @snippet syscon_nss_example_1.c syscon_nss_example_1
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Remap Interrupt Vector Table to SRAM:
 *  Notes:
 *      - Interrupt Vector Table copied to SRAM location (pointed by "uint32_t *ivt" variable)
 *      - The ISR's in use are already in SRAM and the Interrupt Vector Table pointing to the respective ISR locations
 *      - But, current Interrupt Vector Table is still mapped at default location (Flash at address 0x0)
 *      .
 *  @snippet syscon_nss_example_2.c syscon_nss_example_2
 *
 * @par Example 3 - Configure chip start logic for wake-up from Deep-Sleep:
 *  Wake up on:
 *      - PIO0_0 rising edge
 *      - PIO0_5 falling edge
 *      - NFC core activation
 *      .
