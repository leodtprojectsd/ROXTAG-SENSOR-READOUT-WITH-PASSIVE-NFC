/**
 * @defgroup I2C_NSS i2c: I2C driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * This driver provides APIs for the configuration and operation of the I2C hardware block. The I2C interface
 * provides four operating modes:
 *  -# master transmitter mode
 *  -# master receiver mode
 *  -# slave transmitter mode
 *  -# slave receiver mode
 *  .
 * The I2C-bus interface is byte oriented. This driver supports both polled or interrupt based operation. @n
 * This I2C block is capable of addressing four slaves.
 *
 * @par IOCON configuration for I2C:
 *  The I2C-bus pins (#IOCON_PIO0_4 and #IOCON_PIO0_5) must be configured for the I2C Standard/ Fast-mode (#IOCON_FUNC_1).
 *  See IO Configuration driver @ref IOCON_NSS for details.
 *
 * @anchor I2CClockRates_anchor
 * @par I2C Clock rates:
 *  Details on clock rates that can be used for I2C communication can be referred from @ref NSS_CLOCK_RESTRICTIONS.
 * @note During driver initialization (#Chip_I2C_Init), there is no implicit check that the system clock/bitrate
 *  combination meets the clock restriction requirements. It is up to the caller to ensure that the respective
 *  restrictions are met.
 * @note The I2C clock is derived from system clock. Changing the system clock frequency affects the I2C
 *  bitrate, hence it must be re-set using #Chip_I2C_SetClockRate to ensure the required rate is set.
 *
 * @par I2C Master Event Handling:
 *  The I2C master supports two event handling mechanisms which can be configured using #Chip_I2C_SetMasterEventHandler:
 *   -# Interrupt based handling makes use of #Chip_I2C_EventHandler handler.
 *   -# Polling based handling makes use of #Chip_I2C_EventHandlerPolling handler.
 *   .
 *  The user can also implement an own handler using #Chip_I2C_SetMasterEventHandler to perform specific actions for
 *   specific events (#I2C_EVENT_T).
 *
 * @par To use this driver:
 *  <b> I2C Driver is initialized as follows: </b>
 *      -# I2C pin functions and the I2C mode are configured using #Chip_IOCON_SetPinConfig.
 *      -# I2C block reset signal is de-asserted using #Chip_SysCon_Peripheral_DeassertReset.
 *      -# I2C driver is initialized using #Chip_I2C_Init.
 *      -# I2C clock rate is set using #Chip_I2C_SetClockRate.
 *      .
 *  <b> For I2C Master transfers: </b>
 *      -# Set the event handling mechanism using #Chip_I2C_SetMasterEventHandler for the master.
 *      -# Enable the I2C interrupt in NVIC using #NVIC_EnableIRQ for interrupt based event handling.
 *      -# Fill in #I2C_XFER_T structure if #Chip_I2C_MasterTransfer API is used for I2C master transfer.
 *      -# Use one of the appropriate Master transfer API based on the type of transfer required.
 *          - #Chip_I2C_MasterTransfer
 *          - #Chip_I2C_MasterSend
 *          - #Chip_I2C_MasterRead
 *          - #Chip_I2C_MasterCmdRead
 *          .
 *      .
 *  <b> For I2C Slave transfers: </b>
 *      -# Fill in #I2C_XFER_T structure for the slave transfer.
 *      -# Use the #Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup to setup the I2C slave.
 *      -# Enable the I2C interrupt in NVIC using #NVIC_EnableIRQ.
 *      .
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Configuring I2C as Master and use transfer (send/receive) API
 *  - Master mode
 *  - System clock: 4000000 and I2C clock: 100000
 *  - Target SlaveAddr: 0x7f
 *  - Operating mode: Interrupt based
 *  - API used for send and receive: #Chip_I2C_MasterTransfer

 *       - Call Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup() with sid as I2C_SLAVE_X (X=0,1,2,3)
 *       - setup @a xfer with slaveAddr member set to 0, @a event is ignored hence can be NULL
 *       - provide @a addrMask (typically 0, if not you better be knowing what you are doing)
 *       .
 *   - To handle General Call when other slave is active
 *       - Call Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup() with sid as I2C_SLAVE_X (X=0,1,2,3)
 *       - setup @a xfer with slaveAddr member set to 7-Bit Slave address [from Bit1 to 7]

 * @warning If the slave has only one byte left in its #I2C_XFER_T.txBuff, once that byte is transfered to master the
 *  event handler will be called for event #I2C_EVENT_DONE. If the master attempts to read more bytes in the same transfer
 *  then the slave hardware will send 0xFF to master till the end of transfer, event handler will not be
 *  called to notify this. For more info see section below @n
 *  @n <b> Last data handling in slave </b> @n
 *  If the user wants to implement a slave which will read a byte from a specific location over and over

 *  byte instead of sending the byte read from #I2C_XFER_T.txBuff the slave hardware will send 0xFF and no event will
 *  occur. To handle this issue, slave should set #I2C_XFER_T.txSz to 2, in which case when master reads the byte
 *  event handler will be called with #I2C_EVENT_SLAVE_TX, in which the slave implementation can reset the buffer
 *  and size back to original location (i.e, #I2C_XFER_T.txBuff--, #I2C_XFER_T.txSz++), if the master reads another byte
