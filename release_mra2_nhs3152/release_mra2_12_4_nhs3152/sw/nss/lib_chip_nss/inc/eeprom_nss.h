/**
 * @defgroup EEPROM_NSS eeprom: EEPROM driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 *
 * The EEPROM HW block contains two parts: a controller and a memory core.
 * - controller @n
 *  The controller is the interface between the AHB and the EEPROM memory core.
 *  All interaction to and from the memory core is done via the controller (using #NSS_EEPROM_T).
 * - memory core
 *  The EEPROM memory for a specific chip starts at address #EEPROM_START. It is organized in rows of
 *  #EEPROM_ROW_SIZE bytes. All rows (see #EEPROM_NR_OF_R_ROWS) are readable. The lower #EEPROM_NR_OF_RW_ROWS are
 *  user-writable.
 *
 * @par Key benefit
 *  This EEPROM driver abstracts away the access to the EEPROM memory. The API
 *  - resolves all alignment requirements imposed by the HW block.
 *  - minimizes the number of flushes, maximizing the lifetime of the EEPROM.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Usage
 *  - First call: #Chip_EEPROM_Init @n
 *      Before the EEPROM memory can be accessed, it must be initialized. During initialization clock and power are
 *      provided to the EEPROM controller and EEPROM memory.
 *  - Any sequence of #Chip_EEPROM_Read and #Chip_EEPROM_Write @n
 *      After initialization, data can be read and written via the API calls at will. Mind, writes are not immediately
 *      persistent in EEPROM. @n
 *      Both reading and writing, the caller must provide an offset in the EEPROM memory and a buffer with size.
 *      The @c offset for the read and write functions is a byte offset and is relative to #EEPROM_START.
 *  - Last call: #Chip_EEPROM_DeInit @n
 *      Data is only guaranteed to be committed in non-volatile memory after a call to #Chip_EEPROM_Flush or
 *      #Chip_EEPROM_DeInit.
 *  .
 *
 * @warning EEPROM requires a system clock of 500 kHz or higher. This is not checked for.
 *  For a full list of clock restrictions in effect, see @ref NSS_CLOCK_RESTRICTIONS.
 *
 * @par Example - Read, modify and write EEPROM content
 *  @snippet eeprom_nss_example_1.c eeprom_nss_example_1
