/** @defgroup DP_BOARD_NSS dp: board support for the Demo PCB
 * @ingroup BOARDS_NSS
 * The Demo PCB is the promoted HW board for the evaluation of NHS31xx family ICs along with
 * the respective SDK.
 *
 * The Demo PCB provides a couple of features, which are exposed at SW level:
 *  - one controllable LED: #LED_RED
 *  - one button readable via @ref GPIO_NSS "GPIO"
 *  .
 *
 * The initialization function performs initialization of the LED and adds the correct pulls to all the PIOs.
 *
 * @par Board support concept:
 *  Board support comes in the form of a statically-linked library which includes the bare minimum for an application
 *  to start the HW properly (IO pin configuration and/or clock configuration if required)
 *  as well as SW support for the features provided by the board.
 *  There is a single function that is part of the board support API: the board initialization function (#Board_Init).
 *  The board initialization has two distinct purposes. In one hand, to ensure that IO pin configuration and state are
 *  set to a harmless state for the respective board. On the other hand that the features provided by the board
 *  (LEDs, external memories, etc) are properly initialized in SW and ready to be used directly by the application.
 *  Whenever board support is needed for a different board (different pin layout, reduced/extended feature set, etc), a
 *  separate board library must be created, matching the requirements of the new board. As long as the initialization
 *  function prototype (#Board_Init) and the design is kept consistent between board APIs, applications may switch
 *  boards more easily during development or even be run on different boards without changing any code.
 *
 *  @par Diversity
 *  This board makes use of some higher level modules which support diversity: where possible, the default values have
 *  been kept. Necessary overrides have been made in @ref DP_BOARD_NSS_SEL.

/**
 * Depending on the peripherals on the board, power consumption is minimized by adding pull-ups or -downs on the digital
 * pins. These are added at startup in #Board_Init and should have these pulls when the pins are not in use.
 * @note possible values are #IOCON_RMODE_PULLDOWN, #IOCON_RMODE_PULLUP or #IOCON_RMODE_INACT (no pull).
