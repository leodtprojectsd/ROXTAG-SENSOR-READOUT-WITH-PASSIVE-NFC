    with this APP. This APP as downloaded and installed by Licensee and related documentation is hereinafter referred to
    as: &#8220;Software&#8221;;</p>

<p class="fullindented">Now therefore, the parties agree as follows:</p>

<h2>1. Grant of License and Limitation of Use</h2>

<p class="indentedbutone">A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement NXP grants to Licensee a

    consent; or (ix) otherwise use any portion of the Software in any manner not expressly authorized herein.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">D. Except for those rights specifically granted herein, NXP, its affiliates and its/their
    suppliers reserve all right, title and interest in and to the Software. No license, right or interest in any

    Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL), and (vii) the Open Software License.</p>

<h2>3. Term and Termination</h2>

    ASSUMED BY NXP. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS
    WITH LICENSEE.</p>

<h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Since the Software and the corresponding hardware are provided for evaluation and demonstration purposed only,
    Licensee acknowledges that there is a possibility that such could contain &#8220;bugs&#8221; that might create
    problems which could affect Licensee&rsquo;s operation. LICENSEE AGREES, HOWEVER, THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL NXP, ITS
    AFFILIATES OR ITS/THEIR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN ANY
    ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE FURNISHED
    HEREUNDER. THE DAMAGES EXCLUDED UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF ACTUAL AND
    ANTICIPATED PROFITS, LOSS OF PROGRAMMING AND/OR PRODUCTION MATERIALS, AND DAMAGE TO THE BUSINESS REPUTATION OF
    LICENSEE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT LICENSEE MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED ABOVE AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF NXP, ITS
    AFFILIATES AND ITS/THEIR LICENSORS UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND LICENSEE&rsquo;S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR
    ALL OF THE FOREGOING SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES INCURRED BY LICENSEE BASED ON REASONABLE RELIANCE UP TO THE
    GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY COMPANY HEREUNDER FOR THE NHS31XX EVALUATION KIT OR FIVE UNITED STATES

    BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<h2>6. Product Maintenance</h2>

    updates provided voluntarily by NXP shall be covered by this Agreement.</p>

<h2>7. General</h2>

<p class="indentedbutone">A. The validity, performance and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws
    of Belgium without regard to provisions concerning conflicts of laws. The parties consent to the jurisdiction and
    venue of the competent courts of Leuven, Belgium, for all disputes or litigation arising under this Agreement;
    provided, however, that each party may enforce its or its affiliates&rsquo; trade secret and other intellectual
    property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to injunctive relief.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">B. The prevailing party in any legal action arising out of, or related to, this Agreement
    shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, to reimbursement for its expenses
    incurred in such action, including court costs and reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">C. Licensee acknowledges that if NXP is required to bring an action to enforce the provisions
    of this Agreement, the damages may be irreparable and difficult to measure and that NXP shall be entitled to seek
    equitable relief including a preliminary injunction in addition to any other relief available. Licensee agrees that
    in the event that NXP seeks an injunction hereunder, Licensee hereby waives any requirement for the posting of a
    bond or any other security.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">D. Insofar as these relate to the activities under this Agreement, Licensee will comply with
    all applicable export and import control laws and regulations and, in particular, will not export or re-export the
    Software, or any portion thereof, or documentation pertaining thereto, without all required national and
    international government licenses, approvals, or waivers. Licensee agrees that it will not knowingly transfer,
    divert, export or re-export, directly or indirectly, any product, hardware, software, including software source
    code, or technical data restricted by such regulations or by other applicable national regulations, received from
    NXP under this Agreement, or any direct product of such hardware, software or technical data to any person, firm,
    entity country or destination to which such transfer, diversion, export or re-export is restricted or prohibited by
    applicable law, without obtaining prior authorization from the applicable competent government authorities to the
    extent required by those laws. This provision shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">E. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may not be superseded, modified, or amended
    except in writing which states that it is such a modification, and is signed by an authorized representative of each
    party hereto.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">F. This Agreement, including exhibits, constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties as
    to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral,
    regarding such subject matter, and shall take precedence over any additional or conflicting terms which may be
    contained in either party&rsquo;s purchase orders or order acknowledgment forms.</p>
